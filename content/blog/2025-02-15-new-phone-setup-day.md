Received the new phone yesterday. 

We've moved on from one provider,  T-MOBILE, to another,  ATT. Not really sure which is better at this point - they are basically all just a commodity now. 

My line was the last to arrive and the last to be ported, out of six I believe. 

Everything with the setup went okay, just trying to get the final number actually ported and the esim activated took about an hour on the phone.

Overall, my wife probably spent about five hours on the phone with the ATT Costco support line. Way more than desired, and a lot more than we've spent with support on T-MOBILE over the course of 18 years. 

But. Now we should be good. Now we worry about having everything we need from the old phones before we wipe them and send them on their merry way.

Overall though, I do kinda like the new device. I've been a Google Pixel user and disciple since the OG XL, so it's a little different to be away and on the Samsung 25 Ultra train.

I do like the stylus though, haven't had one of those since the Note 7. Which I did not have very long.
