A few months ago my Braun electric razor had need of getting the head replaced, so naturally I procrastinated the actual purchase of one. At which point, I found a cheap replacement head that had decent reviews.

So I purchased one of those. While it fit the Series 5 body just fine, it didn't feel very good on my face. Tugging and pulling and just generally it sucked.

Then I went on and did what I should have to begin with and just picked up another actual Braun head.

What really surprised me, though, is that it was doing the exact same thing. Lots of pulling and general pain.

Fortunately, at one point in time in my life I had toyed around with the idea of going the double edged razor shave route - so I still had my Van Hagen handle and set of blades.

Let me say, there is just no competition between the electric and the manual. I think about the only way I could get a better, cleaner shave might be to go the single edge barber style. But I don't think I'm quite at that point yet!

The really interesting point here is that I don't think it takes any longer to shave - from start to finish - with the double edge than it does with the electric. Plus, I really only need to do so every three days or so.

It did take me a few times - historically - to learn the "touch" and technique with this. Let that blade do the work. It's not gonna bite. I still find that I will on occasion get just the tiniest bit of blood from some bump or other, but even that's gone down significantly.

I'll probably continue along this road. I've found that I enjoy the process so much more.
