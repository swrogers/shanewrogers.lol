I am notoriously difficult to purchase any kind of gift for. 

Anything that I generally want, I have a tendency to go ahead and make the purchase at any and every time.

Anything that I *don't* immediately buy, is most likely because the item just cost too much and I can not justify the purchase.

I do have a few things that I enjoy though, and high on that list is anything and everything Peanuts.

Of the [Charles Schulz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_M._Schulz) variety, of course. Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Woodstock, all of them! I've been enamored of the crew since I was a child.

Some of my earliest memories of reading, not just making things up and babbling and looking at pictures, is of laying on the living room floor, the Sunday Comics spread open in front of me, reading and laughing at Peanuts.

I remember Dad asking me if I was actually reading, then him being surprised when I said yep!

All of that to say that my wife is pretty awesome! She always knows what to get me.
