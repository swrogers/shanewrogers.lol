It's certainly been a day.

And night, honestly. Late last night our eldest came home with his little one. I will say that it wasn't entirely unexpected, and that we as a family are glad to have them here. We are grateful that we are *able* to have them here. This weekend will be a bit of work, as I have kinda taken over the extra room and made an office out of it, which will have to be swapped back over to make room for the two of them.

We've also got a couple of us in the home who aren't exactly feeling all that well. One probably should have come home early with an ear infection/headache/head cold. Myself, I'm halfway stopped up with a scratchy throat and can't sleep worth a darn. It's been a pretty not so fun time overall here in the household.

The twins have the last day of school tomorrow, assuming that they are both able to go. Next year they will be finishing up middle school.

Right now, I'm just sitting here, listening to the quiet that is octonaughts. Who are also asking for peace and quiet. It's kinda meta.
