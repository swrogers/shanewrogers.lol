As you most likely do not recall, back in middle December I decided to give my thumb a [smashing good time in my car door](/posts/a-day-of-firsts).

It hurt quite a lot and after doing the drainage thing for a handful of days it started feeling much better and the healing process began.

Not that the healing process hadn't *technically* began the instant it happened, but, yeah. Very nearly the entire undernail and nail bed bruised and it (still) kinda looked like I had painted that particular fingernail black.

The hope was that I was not going to lose the nail.

For awhile it sure seemed like I was in the clear on that one!

As you probably might guess, it does appear that I'll be losing the nail. Not that it's anything major, just kinda some suckage.

I made the mistake of picking at the edge of the nail, which then more or less started the displacement of it all. The other day I was putting my jacket on, getting it zipped and cozy, and somehow - someway - caught the edge of my thumbnail in the cloth. Half the nailbed came out.

Had to do some trim work on it, will probably be doing trimwork on it for the next few weeks or so. Sleeping with a bandaid on it so I don't catch it on anything in my sleep and rip the bad boy out. That would suck.

It is certainly gnarly, and has been quite some time since this has happened to any of my nails. Our oldest has had the privilege of losing not *one*, but *two* nails in his short life thus far.
