I don't generally like to *meta post", blog about blogging and all that...but there are times that I shall make an exception.

I have finally decided that it is high time to take advantage of some of the features my mobile note taking application has - namely that it does offer templates and widget creation.

One of which is to create a new note using a template, naturally.

In becoming more comfortable with the use of capture templates on my desktop using org-mode and Emacs, I figure that I might as well try to take at least *some* of the friction out of blogging on the mobile side.

Especially seeing as that's where I do the vast majority of my posting from.

While Zettel Notes **can** write in org format, I'm using eleventy for my site and markdown for my content. So no org capture setup on the mobile side, sadly. However, Zettel does have a simple template editor that can fill in quite nicely.

Plus, now I no longer have to remember to change the dateline in my content. That's a win.

I just have to keep better track of which post number I'm on for my current writing challenge. Meh.

Now if I could just figure out how to get Zettel to prompt me for a post title, we might be on business. Although, sometimes I don't know what I'm gonna name things until I'm done.

This is post 68/100 of my #100DaysToOffload posts. You can read the other posts in this series [here](/tags/100daystooffload).
