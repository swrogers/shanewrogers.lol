Well, yesterday (or the day before) my wife had a Costco run.

Normally, not a big deal. Despite the fact that it does run us a few hundred bucks a shot. But that does come with a family of seven. Lots of (teen) mouths to feed.

That said, part of what she picked up while there, something that was completely unexpected, is that we are now in the process of swapping cellular providers. 

We've had T-Mobile for just shy of 20 years. I hate, hate, hate to say that we'll now be on ATT. But, by making the swap out bill will be lower.

Maybe we'll swap providers every time we finalize the conditions of the contract.

It will be nice to have a phone with a stylus again.
