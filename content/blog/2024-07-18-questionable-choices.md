It's crazy the stuff that I have packaged up and toted along with me throughout all of my moves. 

What's even crazier are the items that I *didn't* bring along with me, for some reason or another. 

Items like video games. Lots of cartridges and disks, cases and manuals. 

Games that I wouldn't mind playing again on my SEGA Genesis/SEGA CD/32X (yeah, I had the SEGA Stack....) or Super NES. 

But.

There's always a "but", isn't there?

Do I actually *have* any of those here with me? No, of course not. 

I do have my boxed Dreamcast and some high profile games, but not the older stuff. 

Sadly, I'll probably never see those things again, either. Last year I made the couple hour trek back to my childhood home, with the hope that I could bring some stuff back.

My father (whom I love immensely) had moved an entire home full of *stuff* into a couple of self built storage buildings. 

I was heart broken. Having seen a couple of the figures that I still could find completely covered in dust and dirt and everything, and some electronics just in tatters...the weather had done them no favors. 

Of the items that I was hoping to find (including multiple unopened, complete on card figures) was a complete in box Neo Geo AES with two sticks, memory cards and six games (I think). I can recall Magician Lord, Baseball Stars, 2020 Baseball, Samurai Showdown, I can't recall the others. I'd purchased the whole package over 20 years ago on eBay for less than $600. Good luck trying to find anything similar these days for twice that. This gutted me.

Completely.

These days, as I attempt to go through a boatload of boxes, I just have to ask myself: Why would you bring bits and pieces of this stuff, and not the actual decks that make these things work?!

Gah!
