I'm thinking this is just gonna be a short little snippet of an update. 

There is this part of me that wants to just take a couple of weeks and just "go". No real destination, no real plans. Just get in the car and drive. 

Realistically, I'd rather get on the bike and ride, but that's kind of challenging when one no longer has a bike to get onto. To qualify, when I refer to a bike, I'm not talking about the peddle powered version.

Just me. Just on my own. 

I'm so tired.
