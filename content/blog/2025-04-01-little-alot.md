The end of last week was the end of an era for our household. 

Saturday was the final middle school play performance for our twins, as they are nearing the end of junior high school. 

I'll admit to being an extremely proud parent of those two. That's not too say that I'm not proud of the other three kids we've got, heck I'm proud of each and every one of them. But it's beyond heartwarming, in that it's something one has a very difficult time to put properly into words. I am not too proud to admit to having very nearly come to tears at times watching these performances: be they plays, musicals, or whatever. 

It is bittersweet, though, in that the final play for middle school was not one in which they were able to have larger, more prominent, parts in. However, the roles were very much important to be had. 

The play: *Little Women*. The roles: Professor Bhaer and Mr. Laurence. Both very respectable, and they did fantastic jobs. As an extra bonus the teacher/director is such an amazing and awesome person, who loves all of the kids also really loves our youngest kiddo and does her best to work him into the performances as well - thus we've got photos of all three on stage. Super proud parent moment, that.

As you can tell, I'm one grateful, proud Dad. Quite a lot.

I cannot wait to see them on bigger stages and bigger productions to see what they are capable of.
