Does Sunday count as a vacation day, ergo being the last day of a vacation? 

I can't say that I've ever actually counted the weekends in my vacation, but I suppose they do. 

Tomorrow is return to work day. We'll put "return" in quotes, seeing as I work from home and it's not like we actually left home over the last week.

There were no plans set out for the week, so nothing was accomplished. But on the other hand, seeing as there were no plans to do anything I can't be disappointed that nothing got done!

Win win for everybody on that one.

The family did get out for the Fourth of July (non) event that was held in town. There was music (not that great), craft booths (not that great), food trucks (probably decent, but not our kind of nutrition), and a drone show.

Oh, and a kids play area. Which was fun for the young one.

We went for less than an hour and walked around to see what was what. Finding things not worth it, we left to go get the kids some ice cream cones.

We did go back for the drone show, which was supposed to start at 9:45. 

Then it was supposed to start at 10:00. Then 10:30. 10:45. Then it was called at 11:00. 

At which time it started raining. 

Evidently, the vendor was having issues getting the show code loaded onto the 200 drones via their Verizon Wireless hotspot. They shoulda had T-Mobile. Ha.

The weather had stunk all day, so they weren't able to do the pre-work earlier, either. 

Now, the city has a $30,000 credit for next year.

We were really looking forward to seeing how it went, so I guess we'll check it out next year.
