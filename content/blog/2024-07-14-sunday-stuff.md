It's Sunday. Whatever that means.

The end of the weekend and the beginning of a new week.

Currently we're just taking in the time to watch the youngest play in a local indoor jungle gym. It's a friends birthday party for the little.

So far as Sundays go, it's actually been a moderately busy one.

The boys and I got haircuts. We went to the store.

Spent some time at the local splash pad. Definitely a decent way for the little to cool off, but still.... really hot.

Drove around town for a bit, mainly due to having forgotten when the party started. Ha.

Now, it's all about figuring dinner out. Although I think we'll let the older kiddos fend for themselves with leftovers and pasta.

### Link Dump
I've been a bit lapse on this listing, but then I'm just not too certain that what I've always got is worth it. 

https://spectrum.ieee.org/shipt
Shipt's pay algorithm screwing people over. The gig workers weren't gonna have it, so they took things into their own hands to crack open that black box.

John's Hopkins medical school to be free for most students. This is just amazing. An excellent example of the good that can be done via philanthropy.

Jeff Triplett has a neat example using DuckDB to pull metadata from YouTube.

SSH as a replacement for sudo. This is an interesting idea, certainly with a few hoops. I wonder about setting this up...?

Mainly for my future use, lots of imports and exports for Vivaldi.
