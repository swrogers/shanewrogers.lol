First day of vacation and I'm already sick and tired of it. *Note: it's now the second day, but my feelings haven't changed much here.*

Maybe one of these times I can actually plan to go somewhere or do something, get away from things.

I just don't get it. 

These things should be enjoyable, right?

Does it help that most of the people - it seems - in this home are depressed? I'm gonna go with a "No sir, not one bit" on that one my friends.

We've got one adult who is dealing with a loss of something that never should have happened in the first place (something that never should have to to fruition to have *been lost*, that is). Another adult dealing with their own family issues, which are by their nature spilling over into the home life. Kids who we are trying to keep from becoming depressed.

I'm walking on eggshells around here, and it's extremely tiring.
