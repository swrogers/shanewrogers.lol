Today is Thursday, February 20, in this, what has been yet another exceptionally long week in this year of 2025.

The kiddos had school,  thus far, only one day this week due to insanely cold weather and snowy conditions. 

 We've had whatever illness run through our home over the last couple of weeks,  with the youngest finally getting over most of what he had yesterday. 
 
This weekend is going to be good and busy as well. We've got the youngest kiddo's bday party lined up at a really cool playplace in town, paired up with a friend whose kiddo shares a pretty close date as well - so we just rented the whole place for the morning. 

I've got to look at getting a cake made too, for either his actual birthday or the same evening. He likes Minecraft,  so at least that should be easier than, oh, a Dalek.

We've got a handful - six - of old phones that need to be reset and packed up to send in for rebates. That'll be fun. 

That's all I've got at this point.
