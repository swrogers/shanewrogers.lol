In my last post, I'd said something about wanting to write more about myself. I think it had something to do with listening to a handful of random strangers talk about some of their stories and thinking that, while I may not have something that's directly relatable to the theme, I might have something that could be told. 

Doesn't everybody? 

Theoretically, I should suppose. 

I am a "cusper". A child of the (extremely) late seventies and (moreso) early eighties. I could prefix those with "nineteen-", but just the thought of that makes me feel strange. 

While there was the existence of something that would become the Internet while I was growing up, I would never personally encounter the online world until well into high school. Personal computers were not a thing that every household had. Phones were hard wired to a wall and some even had rotary dials on them. 

Some people had remote controls for their televisions. Those were called "kids". We did actually eventually have a television with a remote, it was kinda cool.

I grew up in a really cool time. We spent a lot of time outside playing. A lot of time with friends. I don't dislike my childhood, but I do think it was a unique time in history. I'm glad that I am not maturing during the current timeframe. I witnessed the growth of technology. For better or for worse.

My childhood was split between a small, unincorporated town and an old lead infested mining town. I think I have memories when we moved into the home that my parents purchased, but memory is a fuzzy thing. A small three bedroom, one bath ranch style home, situated on a corner section of what everyone fondly referred to as "the block." More of an oblong rectangle, less of a square block.

We had what seemed like a fairly large large, complete with chain link fence.  The majority of the homes in the neighborhood were similar, though they weren't actually the cookie cutter style of today's prefabricated HOA locales. The thought that some homes could even have more than one toilet, or heck even an complete extra bathroom, had never ever entered my thoughts. We just made do. Which isn't too difficult when you're only a family of three.

Of course, we didn't live there very long. At least, not as a whole family. 

My parents say, even to this day, that they love each other. That's hard to believe. They were divorced by the time I was in fifth or sixth grade. Fifth I think. By then, I was in the custody of my father and we were in another town. 

A new school, different friends, more to tell. 

For later. Plus, more backstory.
