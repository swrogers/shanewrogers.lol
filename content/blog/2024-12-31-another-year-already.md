Has it really been a year? 

Another one??

Already?!

As one gets older, it just relentlessly accelerates towards whatever the endgame is in all of this. 

The next thing we know, we shall have four more birthdays in the house - one in February, three in March. 

Then it's time for end of school. 

Next it's school starting back up.

Then Holiday season starts all over again.

Somewhere in there, we'll have to mow the lawn perhaps. 

I'll be one year closer to half a century old. Definitely something that I never, ever would have considered anything of import during my youth.

You know, I've never really been one for resolutions. New Year's or otherwise.

They seem silly. It is the extraordinarily rare person that is able to - essentially - flip and inner switch and say "I'm gonna do X" from this day onward.

Sure, goals are great. Targets and milestones are great. But they're difficult to come up with something that's achievable. I certainly don't want to feel like I've failed at something within the first week.

Maybe that's why it took me so long to get my rear in gear on a healthier lifestyle. Keto was a thing that I feared for a decade or more. Not just the cost (which is debatable at this point) but the fear of failure looking wide over me.

Now, are there things that I would like to accomplish within the next year?

Absolutely.

I would like to finish reading *The Expanse* series. I'm on *Babylon's Ashes* currently.

I would like to get some debt paid down. That's actually plausible this year, with the wife having her own insurance this year (same everything, so no real change apart from new cards on her side). That's over $500 a month in our pocket right there.

I want to start a vegetable garden out back, using the straw bale method. 

I'd love to get some permanent LED holiday lights set up on the house. 

Getting the garage organized. Getting our bedroom organized.

Some of these things are certainly more doable than the others.

Ah well.

On a closing note, I started a [Hardcover account](https://hardcover.app/@swrogers). I kinda like it, but I do think I prefer the way books can be added over on OpenReads with taking pics of the barcodes. I may use both for a bit before deciding to stop using either of them, because, honesty. While I need to keep track of what books I've got and read, I don't know that I can actually do that.

Maybe I should add that to my New Year's Resolutions.
