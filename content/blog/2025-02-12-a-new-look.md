For those that might be paying attention you'll notice that I've changed up the templating for the site.

For those that follow this site in their RSS feeds (probably just me, honestly), I'll apologize for the spammage that was just sent your way. Fortunately it looks like it was only limited to the last 10 posts.

I've moved from the old [eleventy-excellent](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent) fork that I had, to a design based around the standard [eleventy base](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) blog design - with a spritzing of [readable css](https://readable-css.freedomtowrite.org). Trying to keep things simple.

The home page is basically the "about me" page that seems to be the popular thing to do these days, along with the latest 5 posts and 5 links that I'll eventually populate. I don't know that I'll do a whole linkroll/linkblog/whatever, and I'll certainly not replace raindrop.io with this, but it's just yet another section for content and a place to save yet more things for me to lose track of.

I'd say this was a lot more difficult than it needed to be, but I think I was just overcomplicating the whole "multiple remotes" and "multiple branches" git thing. Still hosted on github pages, still in the same repo. Yippee.

This is post 71/100 of my #100DaysToOffload posts. You can read the other posts in this series [here](/tags/100daystooffload).
