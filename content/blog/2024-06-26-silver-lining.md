Now is the time to tighten the proverbial belts.

We will very soon be down to a single income in the home. More or less. I do suppose that the older kiddo does have a paycheck, but he has his own set of problems to take care of.

One really has to hope that this situation does not last longer than it needs to, and, perhaps, it can be used to open some doors for another opportunity.

Like now there should be plenty of people hours available to work on getting the home straight for that in-home childcare plan that was mentioned previously.

Is there a silver lining?
