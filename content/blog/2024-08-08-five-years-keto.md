It's funny how some things work out, you know?

Yesterday was a milestone post for my bloggy journal thing, whatever one wants to refer to this site as, and today is a life changing milestone in that today is the fifth anniversary of the day that I started keto.

Five years ago we made huge lifestyle changes. We were both sick and tired of being obese and wanted to see our kids grow up and have lives of their own.

Five years ago we decided that we wanted to model better behavior for our kids, at least as far as nutrition choices were concerned.

Five years ago I was well on my way to diabetes I'm sure of it. On my way to an early death at least.

Five years ago I weighed over 330 pounds. I hated how I looked. I hated how I felt. I hated that I couldn't sleep without a CPAP.

Now, while most of the physical stuff has changed and I'm significantly in a healthier state, I'm still working on my mental health. Though not as actively as I did on my physical body, I'll admit.

But, at least now I can select from a wider variety of clothing while I do it.
