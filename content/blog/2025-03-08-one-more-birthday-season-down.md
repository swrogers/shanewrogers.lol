Some people have *Holiday Season's*, well, we have *Birthday Season*.

In the span of a short handful of weeks, in some cases *days*, we have four birthdays that we get to celebrate. Okay, sure, a pair of those are for a set of our twin kiddo's - but still, that's a couple of birthdays that still need to be seen to.

It's tough to know what to do for a teen birthday party. So what's the best thing to do? Ask them, of course.

One wanted a karaoke machine. Okay, that's easy enough and we'll count that as one gift in the bag. This one also doesn't really like cake - so they both decided that it would be awesome to have an ice cream social during their party, which isn't too difficult. Lot's of ice cream (and non-dairy as well) selection, with some toppings (you gotta have the caramel, hot fudge, chocolate, cherries, sprinkles and canned whipped cream stuff) make for a decent build-your-own-sundae. Plus, I do like to bake, so I threw in a couple trays of chocolate brownies.

Oh, let us not forget the 10 pizzas that needed to be ordered - gotta feed the teens lunch. Ha. And soda, lots of soda. And some water, you know, since it's good for you.

I will admit that I was very anxious about this weekend and this party. It's the whole "well, I don't really have anything planned nor do I really know what to do for a bunch of junior high students during a birthday party." I was worried that I didn't have enough brownies made (there were plenty). I was worried that there wouldn't be enough pizza (there was plenty). I was worried that nobody would have any fun (it seems that all enjoyed themselves).

I don't think there was anything to worry about. Everything seemed to go all right.

However, all said - I think next year we'll just do something like a Dave and Busters, or maybe something downtown if that's an option. I think it might be just as, um, "cheap".
