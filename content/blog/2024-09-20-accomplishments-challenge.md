Yesterday was *disable access and delete our cloud service desk* product day.

I think. The days just kind of blend together. It went fairly well, I think. I've been able to get a small handful of documentation put together as well. 

There was a lot of stuff that got accomplished yesterday, in fact. Got some quotes, got some import scripts written and ran. I still want to go through and clean these up, maybe get them working with *uv*. Assuming root isn't required.

I've got to get some patches on the schedule, which is all good.

### October challenge 
There aren't a whole lot of things that I do to challenge myself these days. I need to change that, so I'm going to go easy with this one.

First, I've decided that my Steam library is just too ridiculous. Plus, my wallet.

I find that I far, far too often get sucked into steam sales and other bundle sales. It's time to try to go a month without making any game purchases.

Wish me luck.
