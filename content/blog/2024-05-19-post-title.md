It's Sunday, which thankfully means that the weekend is nearly, blessedly, over. One of these days I'll figure out what it is about the weekend or time off that I don't care for. Sigh.

Managed to get the dishwasher unloaded and reloaded this morning. Sometimes I still feel very much like that butter robot. Only I get to do more than just "pass the butter", I also get to fetch fresh paper towel rolls from storage! Aren't I lucky.

I know that people don't take me for granted, but good grief sometimes it really does feel that way. Are there things in my life that I would haved changed, given the chance? Sure, I don't think that there is anybody out there that would say otherwise. I try to stay upbeat and somewhat optimistic, but it can be a challenge. Especially when you live with somebody who has depression. Anyhow.

I was going to write something here related to what I've stated above, but I'm not too sure that I want to get into some of these items just at this time. At least not in public. While I don't share these posts within my *close friend group*, neither is this site exactly hidden. I think I'll just leave it at that for a bit. Talk about vague posting, I guess.

Now for an attempt at something a little less depressing I guess. While I really, really have been enjoying Zettel Notes, I would like a way to more easily share pics on this site. Without the need to host the images myself. Yeah, that kinda limits me with workflow simplicity. I've got the pixelfed account, so there is that, but then omg.lol also has a pretty simple image host as well. Both just take a little extra steps. But this should work, I guess.

I guess that should do for today.
