I think I'll keep it short and sweet today. 

I'm at that point to where I think I really stinking despise Amazon deliveries. 

Was supposed to get a couple of packages today, a movie along with some other useful items. 

We received *some* of them. One item, though it was packaged decently, has this ridiculous white scratch mark that shouldn't be there and that I shouldn't have to live with. So that'll have to be dealt with - fine. 

One item, a 4K movie, which had been ordered separately but was shipped in the same delivery (theoretically) was not received. But does Amazon have a way to say "one item from this delivery was not received"? Not that I can tell. So, I just say "delivery not received", with a comment about the item missing. 

I'm done with Amazon. 

At least for now. 

It's hard to avoid them sometimes.
