Ah, welcome to the weekend!

Finally was able to sleep in a bit this morning, all of until 8am. Still feels like sleeping half the morning away, though, especially when one is used to getting up at 6am.

For a Saturday it's been kinda productive, managed to get the lawn mowed for the first time in over a week. It's funny, when I was a kid and had to mow two yards and a large back lot I was never a fan of the chore. It could have had something to do with needing to deal with a black walnut tree....if you know, you know. Ugh. Now, though, it's a good time to unwind with some music and enjoy the process.

Certainly it's not something that I'd consider a chore. My yard doesn't look the best in the neighborhood, but at least it's far from the worst. I try to take at least a little bit of pride in how the home looks. It doesn't hurt that the neighbors also have really nice lawns.

I've got other things around the home that I'd like to do - one of which being permanent holiday lighting with some programmable LEDs. Maybe I can tackle that project this Summer.
