Well today was the day.

We've been working towards getting the new single overall help desk slash inventory slash *cough*project management*cough* service set up for our department for a handful of months at this point. 

Things were finally, more or less, set up and turned on this afternoon. The last thing that was holding things up was the email set up and monitor service. This, evidently, required a lot of thought and assistance from central IT, from the vendor we're purchasing the service from, and from the vendor we procure our email service from.

Even with all of that help, it took hours of working over multiple days.

But, they've gotten it set up for us. It's great to be the guinea pig.

### Cross country 
The twins attended the second cross country meet of the season this week. Both of them were able to run this time and I'm proud as heck of them.

Just finishing one of these things would be a major challenge for me, and these two both do all right. They have made excellent progress since last year.

### Entertain me
It has certainly been a week for receiving movies and books and other entertainment items.

My copy of the Japanese collectors edition box of *Godzilla Minus One* arrived early this week. Blu Ray, 4K UHD, it looks **phenomenal**. Plus it comes with *Godzilla Minus One Minus Color*. I'm beyond excited to have this!

I also picked up steelbooks of *Coraline* and *The Last Unicorn*. Two of my favorites.

My copy of *Dark Nights Metal* graphic novel arrived this week as well. I've actually read the series previously, back when I subscribed to DC Universe Unlimited, or whatever it is that the online DC comics platform is called. Very good stuff and I'm looking forward to reading it again.

In "TV" land, we've been watching *The Fall of the House of Usher* on Netflix over the past week. Pretty decent stuff, only eight episodes so not a lot of filler. The volume is a little inconsistent at times though.

All right then, that's what I've got this time, until the next.
