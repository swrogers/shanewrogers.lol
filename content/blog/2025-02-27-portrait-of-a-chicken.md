A portrait of a "Chicken".

![Photo of a gray and white sheepadoodle. She's laying on her bed, staring straight at the camera, her mouth slightly open in what looks like a smile. 
Her eyes are obscured by her long, scraggly hair.](https://cdn.some.pics/swrogers/67c1118aa7937.jpg)

If you know, you know. ðŸ˜…

....her name, it's Chicken.
