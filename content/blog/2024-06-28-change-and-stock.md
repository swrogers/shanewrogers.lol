I had something written up earlier that I was going to post, but as is often the case in life things change. 

Is it always for the best? 

I find that I am, for the first time in a very long time, contemplating the need to do one of two things: either procure a second income, or find another income. 

Neither of which is something that I desire to any degree.

I like what I do and I like where I am.

However. Something something life. 

Whatever.

I guess it's time to take stock of what my abilities are and what I'm capable of.

What a week.

This is post 10/100 of my #100DaysToOffload posts. You can read the other posts in this series [here](/tags/100daystooffload).
