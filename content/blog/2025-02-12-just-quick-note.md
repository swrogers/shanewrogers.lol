Still doing some final checks and balances on things around these parts. 

I noticed that, for some reason, that old "holiday" post decided to show up in the feed and echofeed grabbed it as well. Not sure what that was about. 

I do know that I had to redo the git repo, again, seeing as how Zettel Notes still had an older version and, with the merge settings I have, happily forced up the older branch. Sigh.

All right. Let's see how this one pops up!
