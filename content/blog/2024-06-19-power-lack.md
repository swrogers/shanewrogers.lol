What to say about today?

Today is Juneteenth. This would be the first year that my place of employment has (I think...) provided those of us who are able to have the Holiday off, off. There are those who are declared as essential, so I would assume that they could have their Holiday moved, or just make the extra pay. I don't honestly know how that will work for this case.

Me, being a white, caucasian, cis dude who is near half a century old at this point in his life...I can not help but just feel really kind of weird having this day off as a Holiday. Now, I absolutely do believe that it should be a Holiday, no doubt about that. 

It just feels strange for me, personally, to have the day out. 

Okay, that's about as political as I ever want to get.

In other moments of not so much excitement, the power was off for an hour or so here. 

No idea what happened, but it did provide a moment to ponder and read a part of my newest book:

I remember watching the series of this when it aired a few years ago and thought that it might make a good read.

I was grateful to have found a good hardback copy of the first printing/first US edition for a really good price.

Here's to eventually getting it finished!
