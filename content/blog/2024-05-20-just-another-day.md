The 20th of the month, and the first time that I've actually sat down at a computer to write a post in, oh, what seems like forever at this point. I've remembered to `git pull --rebase` so - hopefully - there won't be any errors thrown by git. What I've not done is to come up with some kind of theme for todays entry.

The morning was pretty much blown, not only was there no real sleep to have been had (stopped up nasal situation, creating a wonderfully sore throat), but then there was the need to get the two oldest and the youngest kiddos in for their annual "well child" check. Always a good time. At least our family doctor is easy to talk to and we generally really like her. Would definitely recommend her as a local doc anytime I see people ask about who to go to in any of the local groups. The only thing that I (we...) don't care so much for is the fact that her practice was sucked up into the local hospital conglomerate a handful of years ago. Ugh. 

### Just chillaxing here
So, I'm just sitting here putting off one of the more dull parts of my duties. Instead of which, I'm listening to my eldest twin talk his way through an attempted understanding of building a binary input system that outputs an analog number using simple logic gates. Not only has he basically taught this to himself (with a small amount of input from myself), but he has more or less sucessfully reversed engineered a simple prebuilt machine and added a third bit. Listening to him explain the process, and be super excited about his progress, is enough to make this geeky Dad very, very proud.

I've also been kind of halfway *futzing* (that's a technical term there) around with creating a process to pull in a weeks worth of `raindrop.io` links into distinct data directories within this blog. I've got a pretty simple solution that will pull in the previous weeks worth of items, create any necessary `YYYY/MM` directory, then write a `response.json` file containing the items. I guess I'd probably rather create *week number* directories as opposed to month directories though - that would make more sense in that process. The idea being that I could have a weekly post of all the links that I wanted to save and share for that previous week. I also do use the paid raindrop.io account, so I think I could maybe link to the cache - not sure on that, though. At least for me, I could. 

This past few days I've also been trying to get more familier with the [Nyxt](https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/) web browser. It's kind of an *on again, off again* deal with me. Some of my browsing I do over an X tunnel, and nyxt just seems a little bit faster than firefox. Plus, it's `lisp` based and I'm still in that phase of learning new things.

With that, I think we shall call it an end.
