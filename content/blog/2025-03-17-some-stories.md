It's been a slow week or so, not that that's a bad thing at all. Sometimes we just need to take a couple of days and not do anything at all. It's actually kind of nice.

The past couple of weekends had been nothing but *go go go* and it can be just a bit draining on the psyche.

I am back to the point of being maxxed out on my leave at work, so once again I get to take payday Friday's off. Which, I will admit, I have most assuradely gotten used to and most certainly look forward to! Now, if only I could somehow finagle a way to get every Friday off. That would be super nice.

We did manage to get out, either Friday or Saturday - I don't actually remember to be honest, to have dinner and a walk downtown. It was pretty good, nice and shockingly quiet. Well, as quiet as can ever be in downtown Lawrence.

There were a couple of highlights - we found ourselves at a story book session, where people were telling there personal "ups and downs" of life. It did get me thinking, though, about getting words down on the screen of things that I have seen and experienced. While we might not think that our lives are very interesting (believe you me - mine is not) it's still not a bad idea to get the words down. If not for others, for yourself, possibly for your family. Of course, I can't say that I've publicised to my family that this site exists, but I'm not exactly difficult to find either.

I'll have to see what all I can come up with along that line. Growing up in an old mining town, in the middle of nowhere, I've got some tales to tell and they may be interesting to some. Who knows.

Towards the end of the night we found our way to a bar and I found a band that actually interests me - [Dust City Opera](https://www.dustcityopera.com). Eclectic for sure. I can't say that I've heard a whole lot of kick ass bands that feature a trombone and clarinet. Certainly cool, and I very much liked them.
