Last night my head was killing me.

This morning my head was still killing me. I have to say that I consider myself extremely fortunate to have a very flexible career that affords me the ability to take time when I need it. It is not something that need be done very often - not for myself anyhow - but I'm more than happy to take it.

Currently, I'm sitting in the quiet of the dinning area, watching one of the kiddos make some kind of banana *slash* chocolate *slash* puff pastry dessert that he and Mom had seen online somewhere. It looks interesting, and I'm sure it'll be tasty for them.

Did I mention that this kiddo is only just out of fifth grade? He's been baking and cooking for what seems like a couple of years now. The kiddo is very driven and fairly well rounded. 

Normally, anyhow. Sometimes these kids will surprise with some of those "You asked what?!" questions. They are all super intelligent, have gifted IEPs in school, but still - on occasion - they show their age and remind us that they are still children, and need guidance to make their way. 

And that is perfectly fine. It's what we are here for.
