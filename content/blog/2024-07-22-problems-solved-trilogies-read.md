It's been a couple of days since my last update, so obviously there must have been basically nothing going on at all. 

Some progress was made in the work/vendor department though, from Friday and on through the weekend. Mainly in that the patch scheduling foobar was taken care of.

All that took was opening up to two technical support requests. Sigh.

One of which was really only commented on by the vendor representative once. **Once.** I'm not gonna count the comment that was entered *after* the second SR was opened and resolved. 

Once that problem was taken care of, we were off to the races on, well, yet another problem. All of which is somewhat related to every tool being moved to someone else's comput....er...cloud. 

I will give them props, though, because at least this particular cloud took us replacing some old arse java app. So, progress. Yay?

On the home front side, we've got some appointments tomorrow that will need to get taken care of. 

The lawn, yeah, it didn't get taken care of this weekend nor today. I'm hopeful that I can tackle that tomorrow as well.

Otherwise my poor, poor battery powered mower will not make it.

I'm also closing in on a third of the way through reading The Icewind Dale trilogy to my kiddos. Good stuff and it's my second time through this series.
