Tis the season, I suppose.

For some car maintenance and time off, that is. Ha!

Oh, and Christmas and New Year's and all that jazzy stuff.

Yesterday was my last day of, um, "work" for the year. There was much really to do except help with a couple of requests, which was totally cool. Had a handful of things that needed wrapped up and it was actually kinda nice to be able to do so.

This morning was up at the standard time - sleeping in?! What the hell is that?? Had to get the car into the shop for some juuuuust barely overdue service (maybe a hundred miles?). Not too bad.

At least the dealership doesn't try too hard to oversell crap.

That done, it was time to go home. Open door, hear the kids argue.

Sigh.

Dammit.

Sometimes I just wish they could solve their own problems. I basically just ignored them this time. Ha.

In some absolutely non related tangents, I've really been trying to come up with a new from scratch emacs config.

Don't ask me why, I don't have any answers at all.

None. Zero. Zilch. Zip. Nada.

I've managed to stick with Doom Emacs for quite some time now and I just keep going back to that. I like it, sure.

There is just part of me that, I don't know, wants to grok the whole dang thing. For some reason.

The problem is, I either keep trying to basically recreate Doom, or I'm just not really certain what packages I want to start with. 

I've got all of what is consider the "new standards" covered: vertigo, marginalia, orderless, whatever else goes into that stack.

Then I'm like a stinking dog that chases squirrels all over the woods. It gets exhausting.

Plus, I'm trying to get org more incorporated into my desk life - so there's that. I'd say "life", but there aren't a whole lot of decent and mature org related apps on Android. Tmux and emacs running within on my phone don't count, in my mind.

I do have Zettel (using it now!), Orgzly Revived and OrgNotes...but....eeh. I want better templates and capture/sharing.

Anyhow.

Take care, you all.
