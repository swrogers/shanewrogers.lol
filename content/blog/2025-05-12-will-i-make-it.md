I'm beginning to wonder if I'm going to make it to the end of the 100 Days To Offload Challenge. 

The last year has just absolutely flown by. While one might think that "yeah, I can totally make a hundred posts in a year, no problem!", it's a bit more challenging for someone like me. 

Writing up portions of my life every few days is not easy. I work...very rarely go out and do anything...so it seems to me that I've got very little to say.

Not that I'm writing for an audience, I'm not. Just an audience of one - future me. Possibly my family. 

I'm not gonna call it quits just yet. I've got until June 15 to see if I can get 12 more posts out.

We'll see.

This is post 88/100 of my #100DaysToOffload posts. You can read the other posts in this series [here](/tags/100daystooffload).
