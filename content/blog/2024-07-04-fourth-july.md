Happy Fourth of July, for those that celebrate. 

Yet another Holiday here in the States where we, basically, get to set our wallets on fire. 

Quite literally in some cases. 

I will admit that this is one of my favorite days of the year. 

It is currently just after 22:30 Central time, we just finished up with our small handful of fountains and sprinklers. The kids seemed to enjoy themselves, and yet another year with no need to send anybody to the emergency room is a win in my book.

This was also one of the cheaper years that we've managed to get away with, with a bill only just shy of two hundred. 

Yeah, we totally didn't need to spend the money. But think of the kids! Especially the six year old who lives for the smoke bombs. 

Still more than I'd like to spend for an hours worth of entertainment. 

In other news, we will be back to a double income family soon. Super nice.

Until next time!
