This will be the first hand crafted post on the site!

It's **very** exciting! Super exciting, even!

## I think this gets an H2
This should show up under an H2 header, I think. 
Having different templates and css, I'll have to relearn the config here.

### This then would be an H3
Or, at least one level under the above section.

I'll want to add to the data directory stuff for posts that their frontmatter should always contain `layout: layouts/post.njk`.
