To say that I have not really been in a writing mood would probably be a large understatement.

Yeah, that sentence pretty much sums up the way I've been feeling over the past few weeks. Writing, reading, pretty much doing anything - I don't know if it's just the time of year or what, but good grief have I just been in something of a *meh* type mood.

Our past few weekends have felt like they've been non-stop, with hardly any time to rest or recoup and I don't anticipate things slowing down any at all.

This weekend, beginning Friday afternoon, we will be taking off to head to the Southeast part of the State. I've not been back home in a couple of years at this point and we kind of need to get visiting some people. Mainly my Dad. He is getting up there in age and has not actually seen his youngest grandkid (who is 7...yeah, I'm a bad kid I guess), nor is he super mobile which makes it difficult for him to get up this way.

It's only about 3 hours, but it's also about a generation away.

My Dad and I basically get along all right, but there are certain things that we just more or less have to agree to disagree on - and that is okay. Politics, mainly. I just kind of leave it at that.

The hope had been to be able to meet up with some old friends of mine as well, but from the sound of things they've had what was to be an empty weekend suddenly sprout full of stuff to do. That happens, and I totally get it - especially with larger families and teenagers and active kids. We are going to try to at least grab lunch on Saturday, so we shall see how that goes.

I was last down that way a couple of years ago...I don't recall the exact reason for going, besides it having been about a decade prior before that. It was the first time that I'd been back to my old home since before the Joplin tornado. I may not have lived through that, but having family and friends be in the area and experiencing what that was...heart wrenching. Things had definitely changed and I didn't even recognize some of the old stomping grounds of mine. The only way that I could describe it was "surreal".

Last time, I had hoped to be able to bring back a few things of mine from my childhood. Silly things like game systems and models. Yeah, that didn't happen. They weren't tossed, but with a home move and storage not ideal who knows what became of all that stuff. Ah well.

I am looking forward to going, it will be good to have the kiddo's down there with me this time - I'm just hoping that they aren't bored out of their minds. Which, I know they will be. There just isn't much to do in an old mining town that's (while it's doing better than it was) on its last legs.
