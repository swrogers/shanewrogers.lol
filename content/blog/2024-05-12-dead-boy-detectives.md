Today is the twelfth of May. The last day of my vacation, yet another vacation where absolutely nothing was accomplished. I'd feel bad, but I generally don't get much done on these things. Who wants to work on their vacations. Normally I'd take a pair of weeks off, which would at least enable me to sorta almost get something done during the second week. But not this time.

I'm sitting here at someone's home, of whom I have no idea who they are. Well, I guess it's a home, more a ranch. It's a really nice place. But, even then it's one of those deals where I don't know anyone here and really don't have much of a connection with anyone. All I can say and think is, *man, I couldn't even fathom owning this much land or this kind of property*. 

Thankfully we aren't going to be here long.

### Four Hours Later
Give or take. It's after dinner, so it's time to catch up on some entertainment. Today it's **Dead Boy Detectives**. I seem to recall something about a possible spin off of these characters with an episode of **Doom Patrol**, but I could be wrong. 

So far it's pretty good.

In other news, *Happy Mother's Day* to those that celebrate.
