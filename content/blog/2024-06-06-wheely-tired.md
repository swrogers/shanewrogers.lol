Last evening I had the opportunity to update one of our Oracle applications. Something that I've gone through a handful of times now and have been able to fairly well document. It's kind of a flaky system, in that it requires some toggles and buttons being pressed in a very specific order. A rather unorthodox and strange order in our opinion. But, I've got it down to a science now.

Today was uneventful. So excellent.

On the home news side, hopefully tomorrow we will get our second vehicle back after an accident with one of the wheels and a curb. Though it's kind of bittersweet, since it'll be a large bill. Definitely not looking forward to this.

Yeah, I'm still tired and this whole vehicle situation doesn't help.
