Hey, I'm now over 75 percent done with the current 100 Days To Offload challenge!

Now that that's out of the way... yesterday I almost thought that I had lost my Zimaboard NAS parts. I had recalled bringing the parts downstairs to look them over and get things put together. Only I needed to get an actual physical network connection. 

So I put them away until I could figure something out. In what I'm sure I was thinking to be a really safe place at the time.

Yesterday I was thinking, "Self, I haven't seen that Zima Cube thing in awhile, you should probably find that!"

Evidently, I had placed it in about the safest place one could have done so: somewhere I had no idea where that might have been. Which was hilarious. 

Just before bed, I'm standing in our room, looking at the bookshelf that I had put in a few months ago and already filled up. I see this short cardboard box. 

Now, to be fair I had seen and known this was there before. Thing is, I had thought that the box everything was in was larger. You know where this is going.

Medium story short, I found my Zima NAS parts! Along with the pair of 12TB (I think) drives that I got for it. Whew.

### Moving day
Yesterday, our oldest kiddo and his partner moved into a new apartment. We weren't able to help them as much as we would have liked to, due to missed communication, but at least we did get there in time to move some heavy arsed couch and dresser. 

Poor kid was limping pretty well when we got there, I'm hoping he had a good night's sleep.

We were able to have them over to our house last night as well for dinner, which is always good. He had lived with us for, I think, about a year at this point. Maybe. We'll miss having him around. 

We did get them a, hopefully, nice coffeemaker and some mugs. Then, last night I was thinking that I'd love to give them a bag of our coffee... Which must mean that I really, really love those kids. ðŸ˜‚

Ah well, I think we're good for now.

Until next I put fingers to keyboard.
