I really don't like it when I feel this way - all antsy and restless and just way too many things running through my head of what I want to do.

It's tough to keep track of them all.

You start to do one thing, then something new and shiny pops into your head and you make some vain, useless attempt to keep track of what that thing is. Then, when you're ready to start looking into it....everything is black. Nothing. The fleeting idea is gone.

In what I'll say is no particular order, some of the things that are on my mind at this instance in time are:

* Run (yet) another mailserver. I don't know why, I just do. I know it's futile, I know it's not something that would stick around for very long so it would be a pointless exercise. Though I did manage to pick up a nifty family-oriented domain name of the *dot.lol* variety, so who knows....it kinda goes along with the next thing, which is....
* Run (yet...) another federated service. Whether that be something along the lines of GoToSocial, Akkoma, Known, whatever. It would be set up for the family unit to take advantage of. Note that I have intimated that I am already *running* federated services. I've got an instance of GoToSocial. An instance of Known. I've had instances of Mastodon and Friendica. Plus some other micro-styled blog that I don't recall the name of. Snac2 could be interesting as well.
* Then I'd also kind of like to move to a different hosted blog or service or something. I'm liking Ghost, so maybe one of the cool providers that use Ghost. Then that could, eventually, take over for whatever federated system I'm in. Maybe.
* Of course, I still like my eleventy blog I've got here. It's all plain text and easy to move to wherever. Plus it's cheap.
* I've got all the cruft that I still want to do with my Emacs config. Saving all the cool snippets and tips and tricks that I find everywhere. At least I've got an org document saved in a git repo for that.
* Couldn't possibly forget that *guix* system installation that I want to get sorted out. I don't know why, besides the fact that it's flippin' awesome. I've tried *nix* but I just couldn't get my head wrapped around that domain language. I've kind of gotten to where I can actually grok lisp-y stuff.
* Which kind of brings us into wanting to pick up more *clojure* stuff. Not that I could ever actually learn enough of it to get employment in a clojure job, but man, that would be cool wouldn't it?

That's just the tip of the iceberg here. One of these days I'll get things figured out.
