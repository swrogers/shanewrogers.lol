Just got back from taking the kiddos to the local water and amusement park locale...we are all incredibly tired and wore out.

It was, supposedly, a heat warning kinda day - but honestly it didn't seem nearly as bad as it has in the past. At the park, I didn't even get in too bad a shape until towards the end, and to be realistic I was actually cold.

It goes along with water and not having a large amount of body fat these days. Something of a side effect I suppose.

After spending some time with the kiddos in the wave pool, we headed over to the adjoining amusement park and fed the family. The nearby diner has a decent selection of, well, cheeseburgers or chicken fingers, salad, fruit, fries and onion rings.

Lots of stuff that the kids like. 

Since we have four "dining meals" to go along with the gold entry passes, it makes things more worth it to eat a couple of meals there.

But, good grief am I shockingly sore.

### Link dump
I don't know how much I'll have for the weekly link dumpage, but here we go!

- [mayank99 11ty jsx and tsx template](https://github.com/mayank99/11ty-jsx-deno)
I'm not really a huge fan of jsx style templating, but I can certainly appreciate the work that others have put in.

- [Aditya Athalye - Clojuring the web application stack: Meditation One](https://www.evalapply.org/posts/clojure-web-app-from-scratch/index.html)
I haven't read all of this one, but I'm looking forward to going through it all. I love clojure, and I like trying to write apps and web apps with it 

- [Zung Hoang - LEGO camera that works!](https://www.analog.cafe/r/a-functional-lego-camera-kit-lego-zh1-i9j8)
As an *adult fan of LEGO*, I love this **a lot**.

All right, I'm gonna call that a night!

Take care, till next time.
