Shane Rogers is just a guy living in [Lawrence, Kansas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence,_Kansas) with his wife and kiddos.

He likes to [write stuff](/blog) every now and again, most often these are just attempts at writing blog sites. The internet seems to be littered with some of my failed blog attempts.

Eventually, he will have this site set up with all the Indieweb stuff, most likely pulling in data from his [pixelfed](/photos "hey, it's done!"), mastodon, reading, listening and all the other feeds that are out there that he uses.

Maybe.

What he will probably never do, besides actually finishing up the above, is write about how this site is built. We don't do the whole "I'm gonna blog about how I made my blog" stuff. There are enough blogs out there that do the exact same thing. That said, this site is built with [eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), with heavy inspiration taken from the [eleventy-duo theme](https://eleventyduo.netlify.app/).
