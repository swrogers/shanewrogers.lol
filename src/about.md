Shane Rogers is just a guy living in Lawrence, Kansas with his wife and kiddos.

He likes to write stuff every know and again, most often these are just attempts at writing blog sites.

Eventually, he will have this site set up with all the Indieweb stuff, most likely pulling in data from his pixelfed, mastodon, reading, listening and all the other feeds that are out there that he uses.

Maybe.

What he will probably never no, besides actually finishing up the above, is write about how this site is built. We don't do the whole "I'm gonna blog about how I made my blog" stuff. There are enough blogs out there that do the exact same thing. Besides, this site is built with eleventy, with heavy inspiration taken from the eleventy-duo theme.
