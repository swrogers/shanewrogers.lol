# Things that still need to be done

Not that this will ever actually be completed, but here are some things that I might want to consider doing.

- I need to get an emacs capture template made for new posts.
- Maybe get an emacs capture template for normal pages.
- Pull in stuff from my other sources:

    - Pixelfed
    - Targaryen House Mastodon
    - Raindrop.io
    - Last.fm / audioscrobbling
    - Currently reading
    - Finished reading

- Linkroll and stuff

As much as I'm not a fan of emacs literate config, might this be a decent time to convert the ol' doom config over to a literate config and put it here? I dunno...

I believe the theme I'm using already has the Open Graph stuff, but I need to double check that.

I might want to look into the Echo Feed stuff.

I don't know if it would be possible to set up the indieweb login stuff, but maybe.

I do need to make sure that I always - *ALWAYS* - remember to =git pull= before pushing...seeing as how I'm also experimenting with blogging from the GitJournal app.
