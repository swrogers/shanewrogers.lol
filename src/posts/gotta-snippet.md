# One more step down

Now, we have at least one yasnippet for helping to make blog posts.

Maybe I can also sort out a way to wrangle org capture templates to create a markdown file with the frontmatter, then I won't even need the snippet.

Probably should come up with a better file name scheme, too...maybe something with a date on it.
