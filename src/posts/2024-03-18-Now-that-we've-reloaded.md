# Capture template - Sorta Done

Well, it's done enough that I think I'm gonna call it *good enough* at this point. I'm not particularly happy with the yasnippet yet, in that I can'ts eem to get the `tags` entry items to space over and have to do that manually. Whatever. It's fine. It's all good.

I think I need to add a setting into the org capture portion to make sure that the capture window takes up the whole frame, or at least isn't mirrored in another portion of my frame. It's all good, though. That must be the Pete the Cat in me talking. Ha.

I also had to suppress the emacs warning from yasnippet that complained about changing the buffer - so I may have to either live with what I'll consider a hack, or come up with a better way to insert the ISO creation time stamp for the date frontmatter.

I'm sure there is more.

Still plenty of stuff to work on: setting up some data store files to pull in my other feeds, checking into basic webmentions (because I'm super, uber popular....ha)....among other items.
