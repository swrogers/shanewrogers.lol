# Step Two, Maybe

Capture template might be ready to go, now.

Created a new markdown post in the proper directory, with a prompt for the file name, then prepends the year-mm-dd to the file name. Opens a nice empty file, ready for the yasnippet.

I could probably put more into the capture template to do away with the snippet.
