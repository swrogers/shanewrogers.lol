## All I can do is...
Just sigh. In the realm of household appliances, my luck has not generally been very good. Let's just head straight into our latest little issue. We have (had? still have?) a Samsung Dryer.

For most of you who are (not?) out there, you may or may not know that Samsung makes a really shoddy piece of junk for a dryer. The drums in them like to crack and the rollers basically destroy themselves. It's a major issue, and they are basically ignoring the problem.

So we purchased a new set, that is not Samsung. The delivery was this morning, but naturally did not get to go as planned. Something to do with the water shutoff valve not cooperating with the cold water. Yippee.

I just can't even, right now.
