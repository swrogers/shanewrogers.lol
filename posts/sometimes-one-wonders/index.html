These past couple of weeks have been a grand example of that for this household.</p><p>We had purchased a certain brand (<em>cough</em> Samsung <em>cough</em>) washer and dryer. Said brand evidently makes really crappy dryer drums that like to crack and break and basically vomit all over themselves. They don't admit this, of course, and they aren't taking care of the problem. So we bought another brand in a single stacked unit. Because ours is a household that is very OCD about having things be the same. Plus, the stacked unit has the controls in the middle for the short people in the home. Plus we now have a little extra storage room in the washer and dryer room.</p><p>The first couple of guys who delivered the unit weren't the brightest bulbs in the garden. They either didn't know how to unhook the old units, or didn't know that &quot;Yes, Alice, there is going to be a little water that leaks out of the old hose&quot;. So they wouldn't finish the install, leaving the new unit in our garage.</p><p>Fast forward to today, we get the old units removed and the new unit in place. Yes! Oh, what's this? The power cord goes from the top far corner of the unit and is about two (2) feet too stinking short?! No!! Dammit.</p><h2>Misery is a beast</h2><p>Yeah. So, we were super stoked to get the new unit. Now we're basically at the point where we don't even wanna see the flipping thing in the home. But there it is, mocking us. Just sitting there, all unplugged. Laughing at us. No place in town sells a 10 foot four prong dryer cord. Now, we wait for the order from our saviour...amazon. Ugh.</p><p>We really were hoping to get some laundry done today.</p><h2>On the bright side</h2><p>We did get to see some of the eclipse today! So much better than 2017, when it was terribly cloudy and overcast. This one reminded me of when I was in high school (mid 90s) and we also got to experience an eclipse. Very cool.</p><p>With that - until next time.</p></main><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__tags"><a href="/tags/rambling/">#rambling</a> <a href="/tags/household/">#household</a></div><nav class="post__pagination"><a href="/posts/another-day-down/"><span>←</span> <span>Another Day Down</span> </a><a href="/posts/more-updates-and-stuff/"><span>More Updates and Stuff!</span> <span>→</span></a></nav></aside></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__content"><ul class="hero__social-links"><li><a href="https://social.targaryen.house/@swrogers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mastodon</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/swrogers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a></li><li><a href="https://pixelfed.social/swrogers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pixelfed</a></li><li><a href="/feed.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RSS</a></li></ul><p class="footer__attribution">Created by <a href="https://twitter.com/yinkakun" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yinka,</a> Powered by <a href="https://www.11ty.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11ty,</a> Checkout <a href="https://github.com/yinkakun/eleventy-duo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project's github repo</a></p></div></footer></div><script src="/assets/main.31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c.js"></script></body></html>
