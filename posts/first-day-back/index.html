<p>First day back is now in the bag!</p>
<p>Not nearly as bad as those times when I take two weeks off (FSM knows that those both make me want to never take another vacation <strong>and</strong> never go back to work again) but there was still a bit of cleanup and catch up to do.</p>
<p>Some of the cleanup involves coming back in to work post fiscal year end, when it's not necessarily been completely opened back up. Not a huge deal, but still needs to be taken care of.</p>
<p>There is also the metric arse ton of email to sift through. Although I'll be honest and say that I do continue to keep my work email synching through my phone and delete most of the crap that doesn't pertain to me.</p>
<p>Sue me. I don't like surprises.</p>
<p>What was best today, though, was not one but <em>TWO</em> Monday morning meetings.</p>
<p>Back to back.</p>
<p>Right up there with Friday afternoon meetings with my favorites.</p>
<p>Fortunately these are extremely rare for me and Mondays are generally pretty tame.</p>
<p>Well, I'm thinking it's getting close to dinner time and I haven't yet figured out what to feed the kids - I probably ought to take that under consideration.</p>
<p>Until next time.</p>
<p>This is post 15/100 of my #100DaysToOffload posts. You can read the other posts in this series <a href="/tags/100daystooffload">here</a>.</p>
