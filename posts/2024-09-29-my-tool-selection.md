Yeah, this is one of those "I'm just kinda pissed off days".

I despise these days, but I guess at least I know it's a thing - right?

The so called straw today has been the fact that we have to replace the plate on one of the vehicles. This would not be a problem if the plate were easy to remove.

But, no, one of the screws is good and rusted in and now stripped out. Went to one of the hardware stores in town and bought the only screw extraction kits they had - some POS that is. Sigh.

Now I'm waiting on the Dremel to charge up. Yeah, I'm just going to go nuclear on it. Kind of out of options at this point, honestly. 

I just want to know why it is that the State can't just have plates replaced as they go. Seems like an expensive ordeal to me.

Oh well. I need better tools.
