<p>A few months ago my Braun electric razor had need of getting the head replaced, so naturally I procrastinated the actual purchase of one. At which point, I found a cheap replacement head that had decent reviews.</p>
<p>So I purchased one of those. While it fit the Series 5 body just fine, it didn't feel very good on my face. Tugging and pulling and just generally it sucked.</p>
<p>Then I went on and did what I should have to begin with and just picked up another actual Braun head.</p>
<p>What really surprised me, though, is that it was doing the exact same thing. Lots of pulling and general pain.</p>
<p>Fortunately, at one point in time in my life I had toyed around with the idea of going the double edged razor shave route - so I still had my Van Hagen handle and set of blades.</p>
<p>Let me say, there is just no competition between the electric and the manual. I think about the only way I could get a better, cleaner shave might be to go the single edge barber style. But I don't think I'm quite at that point yet!</p>
<p>The really interesting point here is that I don't think it takes any longer to shave - from start to finish - with the double edge than it does with the electric. Plus, I really only need to do so every three days or so.</p>
<p>It did take me a few times - historically - to learn the &quot;touch&quot; and technique with this. Let that blade do the work. It's not gonna bite. I still find that I will on occasion get just the tiniest bit of blood from some bump or other, but even that's gone down significantly.</p>
<p>I'll probably continue along this road. I've found that I enjoy the process so much more.</p>
