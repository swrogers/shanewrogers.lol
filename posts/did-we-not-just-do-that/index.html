<p>It's almost like it never ends, you know!</p>
<p>Received an email notification from <em>Ye Olde Vendor</em> that they were scheduling the next patch for our development environment. Great! But damn...it sure seems like we <em>just</em> went through all this!</p>
<p>I guess that was in mid to late May. But <em>test</em> didn't get patched until flipping June, not to mention <em>prod</em> not that long ago.</p>
<p>Ugh. At least they actually keep stuff updated. No new patches available for the gateway product, yet, so we'll keep an eye out there.</p>
<p>It's been a pretty good week, actually. Got some documentation written and sent out. Got a quote and an order out together for some new laptops to replace out of warranty stuff. Not a bad week.</p>
<h3 id="no-flame-wars-here">No flame wars here</h3>
<p>I figured I'd start a separate header for this one.</p>
<p>I have always been of the belief that you should use the tool, or tools, that work for you and your situation. If that took us, say, <em>vi</em>, then great! If that took is <em>emacs</em>, then great! Personally, it effects me exactly zero on the iota scale.</p>
<p>Whatever makes you happy and floats that boat, or scratches that itch, or whatever. Though, I do believe that every body who is going to do any kind of system administration on a Unix style server should at least be able to stumble through vi or vim. If for no other reason than it's almost always available.</p>
<p>Then even within those two sacred camps you've got people who espouse certain styles of usage. Take emacs, for example. Some people like to use the &quot;starter kits&quot;. Be that purcell, spacemacs, doom, bedrock, etc etc. Some people think you should use vanilla. Some people swear by a literate programming version of their config.</p>
<p>Those are all awesome! Again, use what works for you. Personally, I'm familiar with vi enough that I'm a little dangerous. I don't have any kind of vi setup, I just know enough to get by. I have used emacs for some time now, my first real usage and &quot;config&quot; was spacemacs. Then I've gone through other kits. I've tried rolling my own, with and without a literate config. I've finally stopped with doom, complete with my own customizations.</p>
<p>Just use what works. In Whatever way that is.</p>
<p>That's all I've got on that.</p>
