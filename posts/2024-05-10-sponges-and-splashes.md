My original idea for this month, the challenge of posting a "simple" blog post each day, was to have myself read the "Writing to Learn" book and then give my thoughts on what I had read. This far, I have only succeeded at half of that challenge, having not really made much progress in the book. 

I do say that I'm not really all that surprised. I did take this week off of work, so did my spouse. Therefore I just don't really have much in the way of a desire to sit, read and contemplate. What o have been able to do, though, in stealing away a few bits of time here and there to write, has been of good use. It's been not quite cathartic, but very close, to get words out of my head and onto the screen.

This morning was field day for the fifth grader. We signed up to assist the teachers with attempting to keep the students under some kind of control. Basically just ensuring that they didn't maim each other. I had myself stationed at what I'll refer to as the *sponge fighting* location. One of the handful of water areas that are set up. The idea here being that the kids pair up and toss a sopping wet sponge back and forth. If you can't catch the sponge, then you wring it out over your head. It's all good fun. It all more or less kind of devolves into "let's just throw wet sponges at each other!" 

We go back shortly to help out with the Montessori primary group - the kindergartners. It should be a lot of fun. Our six year old is very excited to have us there with him.

Tonight is another performance, as well. The twins have the last major show for honor choir, which the class has been working towards for some time now. After that, then then of school. It's crazy, how quickly this year has gone by.

It will soon be midsummer. Then it'll be turkey day. Then new years. Then...
