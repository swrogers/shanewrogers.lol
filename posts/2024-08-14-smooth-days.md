The first day of school for the kiddos is in the bag!

Everything would seem to have gone nice and smooth, although it's not that much is actually done during the first day.

I have to consider the fact that all of the kids really enjoy school, which does make things so much easier.

Granted, the majority of them are teenagers (more or less) so all is not peachy and rosy. Sometimes just getting the older ones up and about can be quite the chore.

But, I will most certainly take that little inconvenience over having a house full of kids that want nothing to do with school.

Blessings counted and duly noted.

### Other things that went smooth 
Today has been kind of a day to dread for me. Two meetings that center around a project that has my anxiety levels beyond maxed out.

We are moving from one "top tier, best in class" system (brought to you by Atlassian) to another....which isn't quite as user friendly.

For both service desk (help desk ticketing) and project management. 

The help desk side is fine. Whatever.

The project side. Could use a bit of *TLC*.

It's going to require a bit of a rethink in the way we use the software.

But, even the contact that we were able to work with today realizes and concedes some of the shortcomings.

How fantastically refreshing.

Still, it's not gonna alleviate a lot of the pushback from staff that I'm anticipating.

Still not looking forward to it.
