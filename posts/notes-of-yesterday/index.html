<p>I did not post anything yesterday.</p>
<p>After over a month of managing to get something put up, I skipped a day.</p>
<p>And you know what? That's okay.</p>
<p>It's not a habit until it becomes something more normal. I hope that days like yesterday are more the exception than the rule.</p>
<p>There was some productivity that was had yesterday, despite the overnight rain I was able to get the lawn mowed and some other weeds taken care of. We've got an older Snapper battery operated lawnmower, and I consider it a major accomplishment if I'm able to get the lawn mowed within a single 4Ah battery. If I can get it weekly, it's usually possible, and only takes about an hour.</p>
<p>Still, I really need to run the weed eater though.</p>
<p>The second vehicle is still at the dealership, hopefully it's finished by Monday afternoon. It really stinks not having my car. Not that I go anywhere, or that I could go anywhere at this time. But still.</p>
<p>I've got a question into our insurance agent, wondering about a few things that are related about that vehicle issue, but I'm not overly optimistic about any responses there. Certainly nothing favorable, anyway.</p>
<p>It's getting close to that time to begin thinking about birthday gifts for the spouse. Sometimes I'm just not really in a gift giving mood, and this seems to be one of those times. I do, however, think I know what I'm going to get, so that's positive.</p>
<h3 id="last-weeks-links">Last Week's Links</h3>
<p>I think I'm going to start something new here, too, this week. In something of an effort to reduce the number of open tabs that I have on my phone, I'm going to add to a listing of links that I've found of interest.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a> an older single file wiki based, server less, personal knowledge base application. I haven't used this in forever, it's good to see it's still kicking though.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/how-to-install-and-configure-hubzilla/">How to install and configure hubzilla</a> I like the idea of Hubzilla, and I also like the idea of running my own fediverse something or other. I already have plenty of them, though, and don't need to <em>collect them all</em> in this case.</li>
<li><a href="https://news.itsfoss.com/ente-auth/">Ente Auth</a> I really need to get away from Google Authenticator, since it kinda stinks. You'd think that Google would at least provide some kind of <em>search</em> for theirs, but.... That's asking quite a lot. Ente seems pretty cool, they've also got a photos replacement.</li>
<li><a href="https://cara.app/home">Cara</a> Something of an Instagram replacement that has had really good growth over the last few weeks from what I see. They have really strong safeguards and stances on AI.</li>
</ul>
