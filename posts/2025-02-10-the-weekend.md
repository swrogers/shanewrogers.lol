I don't believe that I have, at least not in some time, had a weekend fly by as quickly as this past weekend did.

In hindsight, I do have to admit that it was great that it went by as quickly and smoothly as it did.

As you may, or may not know - or care about really - we have had a sheepadoodle in the home since late November. 

She is still basically attached to me at the hip. 

I would say she's a quiet dog, but, there are points where her protective side comes out. Hmmm, well, I don't know that I would say protective so much as scared and anxious.

We wish that we knew what she was scared about. Whatever it is, she most definitely *does not* like non household members.

Barks. Some growling. Not mean, just letting everyone know that she's not happy. Then there are the accidents.

At least our floor is polished concrete so it's easy to clean.

So, that's a lot of background to say that we also had an additional dog in the house this weekend.

The second dog was much easier going, but naturally our girl was not happy. Not at first, nor second. She did eventually come around. Sort of.

I had thought it was going to be a long weekend. 

But it really wasn't. 

Who would have thought.
