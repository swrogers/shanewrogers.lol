<p>As you most likely do not recall, back in middle December I decided to give my thumb a <a href="/posts/a-day-of-firsts">smashing good time in my car door</a>.</p>
<p>It hurt quite a lot and after doing the drainage thing for a handful of days it started feeling much better and the healing process began.</p>
<p>Not that the healing process hadn't <em>technically</em> began the instant it happened, but, yeah. Very nearly the entire undernail and nail bed bruised and it (still) kinda looked like I had painted that particular fingernail black.</p>
<p>The hope was that I was not going to lose the nail.</p>
<p>For awhile it sure seemed like I was in the clear on that one!</p>
<p>As you probably might guess, it does appear that I'll be losing the nail. Not that it's anything major, just kinda some suckage.</p>
<p>I made the mistake of picking at the edge of the nail, which then more or less started the displacement of it all. The other day I was putting my jacket on, getting it zipped and cozy, and somehow - someway - caught the edge of my thumbnail in the cloth. Half the nailbed came out.</p>
<p>Had to do some trim work on it, will probably be doing trimwork on it for the next few weeks or so. Sleeping with a bandaid on it so I don't catch it on anything in my sleep and rip the bad boy out. That would suck.</p>
<p>It is certainly gnarly, and has been quite some time since this has happened to any of my nails. Our oldest has had the privilege of losing not <em>one</em>, but <em>two</em> nails in his short life thus far.</p>
<p>This is post 73/100 of my #100DaysToOffload posts. You can read the other posts in this series <a href="/tags/100daystooffload">here</a>.</p>
