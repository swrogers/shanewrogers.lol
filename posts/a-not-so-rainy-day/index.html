<p>Happy Father's Day Eve!</p>
<p>To all of those who are parent figures to somebody or other who needs the support or the assistance, here's to a day filled with the joy and happiness that goes along with that personal fulfillment!</p>
<p>As a father figure to my kiddos, I have cherished every day I've been around them. Have they all been easy days? Oh, heck no. But even those difficult and challenging days are completely worth it.</p>
<p>Anyhow, on to today's stuff!</p>
<p>Not that I've got anything really special to impart today.</p>
<p>It was supposed to rain today, so the first thing I did upon waking up was head out and get the lawn mowed. It takes about an hour, so long as I'm able to keep up on it every week.</p>
<p>We've got an old Snapper battery operated mower, with a 4Ah and a 2Ah battery pair. I really love it when I can get things done within a single battery. This morning was no different.</p>
<p>While the battery operated mower is nice and we don't have to put up with having a gasoline container in the garage, it does entail the need to mow more often. Otherwise you wind up with a field that the poor machine just can't deal with.</p>
<p>Did it wind up raining? Of course not. It looked pretty gnarly though.</p>
<p>I'm sure it'll rain tomorrow though. That would be perfect, especially since we plan on heading to World's Of Fun for the day.</p>
<p>Lastly, I'm considering doing the whole <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">100 Days To Offload</a> challenge.</p>
<p>I figure that since I'm trying to write more that it might be something worth doing. I like personal challenges of this sort.</p>
<p>With that, until next time.</p>
