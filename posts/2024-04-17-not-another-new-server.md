## Another Fediverse Server?!
No, I don't have _yet another fediverse server instance_ stood up. 

Not for some lack of trying, mind you, I just don't have the energy to put into working through all the nits and nats that are involved with ruby. I shudder to think. I've never really been a huge fan of that whole ecosystem.

It's not as bad as the JavaScript world, but it's not fun to navigate for me either.

I was wanting to get a [Diaspora](https://diasporafoundation.org/) instance set up on a digital ocean droplet, but decided against it. Then, to follow along in some other rabbit hole, I signed up on Yet Another ActivityPub Instance, in the form of [Akkomane Social](https://akkomane.social/@shane). It seems nice, thus far.

In other news, yeah - it's been a week.

It's also only Wednesday.
