A Saturday down, a kiddo and his first chess tournament.

A very successful day, all in all. 

Today was not all roses and daffodils, however. Yesterday afternoon I pulled a real doozy move and somehow managed to close my right thumb in the driver's side door of my car. How in the nine hells I managed to do that I have absolutely no flipping clue, I wasn't thinking at all and just managed to ever so slowly and methodically gently close my thumb in the door.

It smarted, quite a bit. My dog was in the car, my youngest was in the car. I let out quite the yelp. 

After attempting to yank my thumb free I realized that wasn't gonna work, so I'm glad I was able to relax and actually open the door. 

It still hurts. From the tip of the digit to the middle of the palm. I'll be shocked if I don't lose the nail. 

Anyhow, back to today.

Up good and early for a Saturday at 0700. I'd been up since 0600 with the thumb throbbing in pain anyhow. Shower. Coffee made. Dog taken out and fed. Snacks and easy provisions gathered and our the door.

We got little man registered and set up around 0845. Then 6 rounds of chess. He had on win and two draws, for two points. We call that a successful first event for the first grader!

His team tied for third, but got fourth due to the point tiebreaker. Still not too shabby.

Done a little before 1700, then off to the DQ for a Blizzard and O-rings! He'd never had DQ before. 

It was also my first chess tournament, quite the experience.

All told, not a bad day.
