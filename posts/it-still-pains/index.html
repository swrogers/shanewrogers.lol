<p>Ah, the great and powerful Monday.</p>
<p>I actually don't mind Mondays. Sure for some people it's the beginning of the work week (myself included), but it also means a great day of getting stuff done at work with little interruption.</p>
<p>Naturally today we had about an hour long team meeting to discuss projects new/old/upcoming and other leadership tidbits. I don't mind, at least it wasn't a 3pm (4pm!) meeting on a Friday. Those stink.</p>
<p>In household news, the granddaughter is starting to feel more and more comfortable. She does get a little upset and sad when her Dad leaves the room or goes to work, but it passes much quicker now than it used to. She's a whole lot happier and just seems to be in a better mood overall now. It's great to see.</p>
<p>Today we also found out what the final cost of repairs are going to be on the vehicle. Shockingly not as bad as I was anticipating, but then I did have a worse case scenario in my head, just so I could be relieved if that was not the case. It still hurts and is money out the door and straight into the incinerator, but it could have been about a thousand dollars worse.</p>
<p>Now all we need is for a major appliance to vomit all over itself and call it a day.</p>
<p>I'm thinking it's about time to get some dinner prepped, so off to do that I go.</p>
