Whew, one day post birthday and one more on the books.

For myself, I consider my birthday to be just another day. I can't say that I really care how the day goes, one way or the other. I would assume, like most other adults my age - it's just another day.

I'm 47 as of yesterday. It's not a milestone year, just another step in the path.

I don't feel 47. It's no different to me than, say 42 or 45. 

It's kind of surreal, if I were to say it was anything. 

When you're a kid, you don't really think of middle age. It's just something that you don't really see yourself being.

Then, all of a sudden, your trying to put things into perspective. I try to place myself into my father's mindset and shoes and whatever when he was my age. How things were back then.

How things have changed.

I'm sure there's a word for the way I think, the way I feel.

Ah well.

### B-Day Stuff 
The day before my birthday, we made pizza for the kiddos so the wife and I could get out and have a good dinner. I guess by good, I mean expensive. 

Well, of course it was good. We went out to a local fish house and raw bar. Big plate of broccolini and a delicious Greek salad with some of the sweetest cherry tomatoes we'd ever had. Then a large plate of oysters, shrimp, lobster tail and snow crab. Pretty good.

Yesterday, we went to Worlds of Fun. Probably not the best idea as it was super busy. Gotta love lines. We were there maybe six hours and my eldest twin and I only rode three things. We've got passes, though, so we'll go back eventually.

Today, we are just relaxing. New school year shoe purchases and mowing the lawn.

Tomorrow, while not the first day of school, is close enough that the flurry will commence. I'm a little anxious about it all, the mornings are going to be really hectic around here.

DEFCON is going on currently, and I love a good tale. I imagine that most of us have received those stupid "USPS" delivery package text messages. Here, Grant tells the tale of, ahem, someone taking things into their own hands.

I don't really write in Go, but I'd like to. This seems like a decent list of what to avoid, perhaps.

I don't think I could explain it any better than they could: *It's like Font Awesome, but for Platforms & Protocols*

I'm more of an Emacs user, but I can certainly appreciate Wordstar. Here is an **awesome** package put together by author Robert J Sawyer.

With that, I think we're good.
