First day back is now in the bag!

Not nearly as bad as those times when I take two weeks off (FSM knows that those both make me want to never take another vacation **and** never go back to work again) but there was still a bit of cleanup and catch up to do. 

Some of the cleanup involves coming back in to work post fiscal year end, when it's not necessarily been completely opened back up. Not a huge deal, but still needs to be taken care of. 

There is also the metric arse ton of email to sift through. Although I'll be honest and say that I do continue to keep my work email synching through my phone and delete most of the crap that doesn't pertain to me.

Sue me. I don't like surprises. 

What was best today, though, was not one but *TWO* Monday morning meetings. 

Back to back. 

Right up there with Friday afternoon meetings with my favorites.

Fortunately these are extremely rare for me and Mondays are generally pretty tame.

Well, I'm thinking it's getting close to dinner time and I haven't yet figured out what to feed the kids - I probably ought to take that under consideration. 

Until next time.
