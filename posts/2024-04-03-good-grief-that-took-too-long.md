## More site updates
Now I've added another section to the olde interweb presence: [Drops](/drops). 

"What are drops?" I can hear absolutely nobody asking...well, I'm glad you asked! Basically they're my *Read It Later* links that I use some other web service to save for me - both the actual link, the data on the page, content and all that jazzy stuff. It's a service that I actually - shock! awe! - pay for.

I'd like to have all of that data *here* on this site - well, I guess it'd be in the github repo, but still. As it is, I grab the latest 25 entries and display them on the [drops](/drops) page. I suppose at some point in time I'll actually build in some kind of link roll or link blog or whatever, that way I can have the actual history in my site - but for now this is fine.

It took me way, **way** too stinking long to get the secrets info dealt with for the github action. Too many tangents and too many wrong turns. But things seem to be working now.

Time for some breakage I think.
