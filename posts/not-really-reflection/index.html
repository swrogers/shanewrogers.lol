<p>I have just not really been feeling it over the last week.</p>
<p>I do believe that I shall leave it to as an exercise for the reader to figure out why that might be.</p>
<p>Friday was my &quot;off work&quot; Friday, so it's essentially a four day weekend for me, what with tomorrow being Veteran's Day. I guess I won't actually complain about that, since there really are worse things going on right now.</p>
<p>Eventually, my complaints won't even be referable as <em>first world problems</em>, for, you know, reasons.</p>
<p>I just don't understand some people's children.</p>
<p>But, I sure do believe that we're gonna waltz right into the <em>find out</em> portion of the night's program.</p>
<p>And I, absolutely, one hundred percent, hope those people find the.... Yeah.</p>
<p>The rather unfortunate aspect of all of this being, that those of us who do understand some of these things will also get to go along with this ride.</p>
<p>I don't know who to blame.</p>
<p>I don't know, I didn't understand.</p>
<p>What I do know, is that I am at least fortunate being what I <em>am</em>. A white, hetero male.</p>
<p>I guess I'm lucky.</p>
<p>I'm also glad that I've already got a mortgage and a roof over our heads.</p>
<p>I just want my family and kiddos and friends to be able to live and work and play in a safe world.</p>
<p>I'm not too sure that's going to be the case.</p>
