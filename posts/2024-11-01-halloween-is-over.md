I think I'm slowing down.

I'm moderately certain that I am slowing down.

Not that I want to make this post be anything more than a "Hey, guys! I'm *almost* halfway finished with my 100 days challenge!" But yeah, that may be dang near what this turns into.

Today is November 1. (Which reminds me, I need to update the front matter to this post.) Which would make yesterday Halloween. Yep.

We took the two youngest kiddos out trick or treating last night, along with  a couple of the older ones friends. We had a pretty good time. What were we all dressed as, I hear absolutely nobody asking....well, I'll be glad to say!

We had Thing 1 and Thing 2, a Minecraft Ender Dragon and the final kid didn't really have a costume unless you counted their standard daily "skater grunge punk" as a costume... meh why not!

The wife dressed up as a good looking broken doll, while I was some dapper looking gentleman from old time-y whenever and wherever. It was fun.

The older two did also dress up, though one went out with his friend to trick or treat, while the other started out at the community garden before heading downtown. The first was a cool looking anime school character while the other was some kind of dark leather bound bird demon or something.

I'm glad that's over, though. More or less.

Now it's all about getting ready for the holidays.

I'm just kinda sad that I never made it to the World's of Fun Haunts.
