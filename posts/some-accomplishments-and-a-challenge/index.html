<p>Yesterday was <em>disable access and delete our cloud service desk</em> product day.</p>
<p>I think. The days just kind of blend together. It went fairly well, I think. I've been able to get a small handful of documentation put together as well.</p>
<p>There was a lot of stuff that got accomplished yesterday, in fact. Got some quotes, got some import scripts written and ran. I still want to go through and clean these up, maybe get them working with <em>uv</em>. Assuming root isn't required.</p>
<p>I've got to get some patches on the schedule, which is all good.</p>
<h3 id="october-challenge">October challenge</h3>
<p>There aren't a whole lot of things that I do to challenge myself these days. I need to change that, so I'm going to go easy with this one.</p>
<p>First, I've decided that my Steam library is just too ridiculous. Plus, my wallet.</p>
<p>I find that I far, far too often get sucked into steam sales and other bundle sales. It's time to try to go a month without making any game purchases.</p>
<p>Wish me luck.</p>
<p>This is post 40/100 of my #100DaysToOffload posts. You can read the other posts in this series <a href="/tags/100daystooffload">here</a>.</p>
