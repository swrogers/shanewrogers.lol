<p>Lucky number thirteen!</p>
<p>I wasn't too certain that I was going to make this one, if I were to be completely honest. It's been a day full of watching a sick kiddo and trying to keep myself in check as well. To say that it has not been a great day would be an understatement at the least.</p>
<p>We've had a couple of really long nights, as our youngest has been making his way into our room (which is not so different from the normal) and coughing up a storm (which is different from the norm). Hopefully he'll be able to get this thing beat soon.</p>
<p>I will say that I'm lucky in that my job is very flexible in allowing us to e to care for family and self. I know that not everyone is so fortunate. For that, I am thankful.</p>
<p>As an aside, I have finally been able to watch <strong>Dune Part Two</strong>, which was excellent. I had really wanted to see it in a theater but was never able to make it. The first <strong>Dune</strong> was actually the he first movie I saw in the theater after the world had began to open back up. Some might say post COVID, but I think that we all know we are still current COVID. Sigh.</p>
<p>These entries have been good for just getting my mind settled and thawed out for the day. While nowhere near what I had intended to write about, I hope to be able to continue on this path. Whether anyone reads them or not, matters not to me.</p>
<p>Wanna read my other <a href="/tags/weblogpomo2024">#weblogpomo2024</a> posts?</p>
