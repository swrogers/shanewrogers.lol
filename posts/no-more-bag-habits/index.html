<p>Bad habits. I seem to have fallen back into some of them. Most of which seem to revolve around food, which I can only blame myself really. I've been doing a keto lifestyle since August of 2019, about five years at the time of this, and it could be said that I'm still keto.</p>
<p>I generally stay under twenty net carbs a day. No sugar. None of what works normally be considered a part of the regular American diet. It was a change that needed to be made if I wanted to live to see my kids grow up and not find myself in an early grave. By all measures the change has been a glowing success.</p>
<p>Lately though, and by <em>lately</em> I should probably qualify that with about the last year or so, I've been really, really bad about continuing to log what does go into my body. I have been really bad about junk food. I've probably already talked about what I consider junk food, it's not really what my fellow neighbors would consider junk. But, high calorie crap that I absolutely, positively, do not need. If I do partake, I've got to ensure it's accounted for. I don't always do that, so shame on me.</p>
<p>This morning, I weighed nearly 194 pounds. Still down from 330 plus, but in my eyes, I see that getting far too close to the double century mark for my liking. This guy has got to get back into only eating when he's hungry. That's my bad habit now.</p>
<p>I never really &quot;ate my feelings&quot;. I always ate out of boredom or habit. It didn't take long to drop breakfast. Then lunch eventually fell as well. I need, I have the desire, to feel that hunger once again.</p>
<p>As they say: <strong>Keep On Keto On</strong></p>
