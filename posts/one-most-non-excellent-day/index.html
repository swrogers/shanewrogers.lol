<p>Good grief has it been a rough day.</p>
<p>Had the youngest kid home today, &quot;sick&quot;, from school.</p>
<p>Naturally, when I got back home from picking one of the twins up from zero hour to take him to school number two, the child was all &quot;I feel much better now, can I do this other thing that I am not allowed to do on days that I'm home sick from school?&quot;</p>
<p>Of course, that wasn't <em>exactly</em> how he asked, but I'm sure the idea has been transferred.</p>
<p>That was also not the only thing that was asked for, nor were these questions only asked one time.</p>
<p>Incessant, constant nagging.</p>
<p>It really, just kind of grates on the mood and makes one want to just disassociate.</p>
<p>After all of that, then it's time to get dinner prepped and ready. Something that I generally actually enjoy doing.</p>
<p>Cooking is fun. Relaxing. Prepping things that people might want to eat.</p>
<p>Low and behold, today was the attack of the crummy, small, no stinking room in it, kitchen.</p>
<p>No room in the floor. Nor the countertop. Cat food spilled all over the floor. Cauliflower dropped on the floor.</p>
<p>There are some days where it just feels like the world is out to get you. I know that's ridiculous.</p>
<p>But oh my ever loving lord.</p>
<p>This is post 41/100 of my #100DaysToOffload posts. You can read the other posts in this series <a href="/tags/100daystooffload">here</a>.</p>
