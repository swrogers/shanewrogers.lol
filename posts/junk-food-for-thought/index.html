<p>It's the eleventh of May. Saturday. A day to do not a whole lot. Same as tomorrow I guess.</p>
<p>I've been trying for most of the day to come up with some kind of theme for todays post. I guess it's been staring me in the face for the day as well, if only I could open the proverbial eyes. It has actually been making its path through my hands, in front of my face and down the old gullet multiple times today.</p>
<p>It's kind of funny, what is one person's junk food is not the same as every body else's junk food. What was junk food for me me years ago is completely off limits to me now, nor do I crave those items now. Thankfully. Today, my junk food is stuff like cheese, natural peanut butter, macadamia nuts. All high calorie stuff.</p>
<p>When we first started keto, I thought that must difficult things to give to would be all the baked goods: cookies, biscuits, cakes, etc. I mentally gamed it, though, and was able to conquer those cravings. My first hump was getting past 220 and into the so-called <em>one-derland</em>. Now, that I've been past there, into the 170s, my new plateau is trying to get back below 180. I've continued to be in the 190s for longer than I like.</p>
<p>I really need to get back into that track, stop snacking, get away from the peanut butter and dairy, start tracking everything that goes on my plate once again.</p>
<p>I've started not feeling my best. I need to get there once again.</p>
