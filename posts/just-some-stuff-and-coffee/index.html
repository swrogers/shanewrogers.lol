<p>Ugh, I just haven't been feeling it lately!</p>
<p>I had even made the attempt to start a post the other day. Got as far as copying my template over to the ol' draft folder.</p>
<p>Dunno what happened but that's as far as that went.</p>
<p>It's been kinda <em>meh</em> around these parts lately.</p>
<p>At least <strong>most</strong> of the snow has gone, the temperature has kinda been decent (for what that's worth at this point), and everything has been more or less healthy around the household.</p>
<p>There have been some points of interest though.</p>
<p>I need to pick up a new smoke/carbon monoxide detector for our hallway. Just have not been able to get to the store yet for a replacement. I did, however, at least get an adapter kit so I can just reuse the existing wire harness with the new style that Kidde goes with these days.</p>
<p>We attended parents night at the local High School the other day. The twins start 9th grade next year, and it's always good to feel prepared. I feel that we (well, <em>me</em>, at least) are more prepped for these two than we were for their older brother. I still think, sometimes, that poor kiddo got the worst end of the stick from me. I love the hell out of him, but I just didn't know what I was doing through the whole thing. However, despite that lack from me, has turned out pretty well.</p>
<p>I'm just glad that our Cameron's Coffee order came through before those prices shot through the roof. Plus, I already had a four pack case (we have a monthly standing order for four 32oz bags) just sitting around. We go through a case a month in our house. I'm not looking forward to the future there.</p>
<p>I think that's all I've got.</p>
<p>For now.</p>
