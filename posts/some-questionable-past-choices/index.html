<p>It's crazy the stuff that I have packaged up and toted along with me throughout all of my moves.</p>
<p>What's even crazier are the items that I <em>didn't</em> bring along with me, for some reason or another.</p>
<p>Items like video games. Lots of cartridges and disks, cases and manuals.</p>
<p>Games that I wouldn't mind playing again on my SEGA Genesis/SEGA CD/32X (yeah, I had the SEGA Stack....) or Super NES.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>There's always a &quot;but&quot;, isn't there?</p>
<p>Do I actually <em>have</em> any of those here with me? No, of course not.</p>
<p>I do have my boxed Dreamcast and some high profile games, but not the older stuff.</p>
<p>Sadly, I'll probably never see those things again, either. Last year I made the couple hour trek back to my childhood home, with the hope that I could bring some stuff back.</p>
<p>My father (whom I love immensely) had moved an entire home full of <em>stuff</em> into a couple of self built storage buildings.</p>
<p>I was heart broken. Having seen a couple of the figures that I still could find completely covered in dust and dirt and everything, and some electronics just in tatters...the weather had done them no favors.</p>
<p>Of the items that I was hoping to find (including multiple unopened, complete on card figures) was a complete in box Neo Geo AES with two sticks, memory cards and six games (I think). I can recall Magician Lord, Baseball Stars, 2020 Baseball, Samurai Showdown, I can't recall the others. I'd purchased the whole package over 20 years ago on eBay for less than $600. Good luck trying to find anything similar these days for twice that. This gutted me.</p>
<p>Completely.</p>
<p>These days, as I attempt to go through a boatload of boxes, I just have to ask myself: Why would you bring bits and pieces of this stuff, and not the actual decks that make these things work?!</p>
<p>Gah!</p>
