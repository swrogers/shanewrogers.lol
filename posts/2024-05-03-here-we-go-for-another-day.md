It's day three of Weblog Posting Month 2024!

Whew! 

I'll be honest, I was beginning to wonder if I was going to make it today. Today has been challenging, to say the least, so I will be putting off today's reading of the "Writing to Learn" book.

"Why is that?" - I hear absolutely noone asking. Well, I'll tell you anyhow. I do much of my blog posting through `emacs` using `org-mode` capture templates. My current `emacs` configuration is a semi modified [doom emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs) build which has worked very well for me in the past and continues to do so in the present. Generally. I don't know if I had some kind of hardware issue (which is possible, as my config is hosted on a local NAS with used drives) due to perhaps a recent storm, but my org capture templates were just not working at all. Even after a `doom doctor`, `doom purge`, `doom build` cycle...nothing worked. 

Which necessitated a *nuclear option* of a fresh git checkout of doom and starting over. It's not really a complete do over, though, since I still have my private/personal doom init files that live in a different directory.

All in all, after about an hour and ten minutes of waiting for the build process to finish (ugh...) we are back to par. Yippee.

### The actual challenge
Everything stated, I have actually read a bit of the next chapter, and all of the above was initiated because I wanted to take a handful of notes. One item in particular, about clear writing being evidence of clear thinking. Something of which I really need to strive to do - think clearly. With that, and just a little bit of focus, perhaps I can write clearly.
