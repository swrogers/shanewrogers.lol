<p>I don't believe that I have, at least not in some time, had a weekend fly by as quickly as this past weekend did.</p>
<p>In hindsight, I do have to admit that it was great that it went by as quickly and smoothly as it did.</p>
<p>As you may, or may not know - or care about really - we have had a sheepadoodle in the home since late November.</p>
<p>She is still basically attached to me at the hip.</p>
<p>I would say she's a quiet dog, but, there are points where her protective side comes out. Hmmm, well, I don't know that I would say protective so much as scared and anxious.</p>
<p>We wish that we knew what she was scared about. Whatever it is, she most definitely <em>does not</em> like non household members.</p>
<p>Barks. Some growling. Not mean, just letting everyone know that she's not happy. Then there are the accidents.</p>
<p>At least our floor is polished concrete so it's easy to clean.</p>
<p>So, that's a lot of background to say that we also had an additional dog in the house this weekend.</p>
<p>The second dog was much easier going, but naturally our girl was not happy. Not at first, nor second. She did eventually come around. Sort of.</p>
<p>I had thought it was going to be a long weekend.</p>
<p>But it really wasn't.</p>
<p>Who would have thought.</p>
