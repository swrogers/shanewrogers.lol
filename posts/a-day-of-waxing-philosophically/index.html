<p>It's day the next around these parts. For whatever that means, right? I've not made nearly the progress on my book that I'd like to, so today's entry will be another one of those &quot;day in the life of&quot; ordeals. I might even be able to make this interesting, but I wouldn't let odds down.</p>
<p>This year I turn 47. Not quite the same as when one turns 40, though let's be honest here, I don't think my 40th was anything all that spectacular. Nor is it quite the same as turning 50, I'm guessing. As I get older and watch my kids get older, I can't help but think that it really wasn't all that much long ago that I was their age, almost in their shoes, going through similar phases. I've tried to do my absolute best buy my kids. My Dad, who I love, has probably told me that he loves me only a handful of times. I know he does, but I've tried to reverse that trend with my boys.</p>
<p>I think back to some of the points in my life, I try to correlate how old my kiddo's are, to how old I was, to how old my Dad was (or, would have been at that time). I always wonder what would have been going through his mind. It's just strange, trying to put myself into his place. There are differences between the two of us, there is no doubt there. As parents, we try to ensure that our children have access to things that we never had - or, in my case things that I never knew that I should have or would have wanted. Things as simple as high school yearbooks.</p>
<p>I didn't go to a large high school, nor did I have an over abundance of friends, nor did I ever think that I would want to ever reminisce about those years of my life. Of course, growing up I think I must have thought that yearbooks just magically showed up at school on yearbook signing day. It never would have occurred to me that there was an (at times) significant cost involved. My kids may not realize it now, but they'll be thankful for those, at least, in the future.</p>
<p>Yes, we love our kids and want the best for them. Though, what parent does not.</p>
<p>Anyway, with that I think we shall close out this day.</p>
