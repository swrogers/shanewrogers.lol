What all is going on this week? 

Not a whole heck of a lot, although I do suppose that there will be a holiday of some sort thrown into the mix, in one way or another. 

We've got most of the costume situation sorted out, at least for those that want them. 

The major question is whether or not the last one is going to arrive in time. I do believe that things are going to be very close.

Last week was pretty good over all. One contract at work was finally taken care of, which is one giant weight off of my shoulders.

I've also recently (re)learned, after having forgotten, that Oracle is no longer supporting their graphical catalog manager from the BI tools packages. They are, however, continuing development of the command line client.

Which, I suppose, is actually not a bad thing as I can script that bad boy to get my reports.

This upcoming week should be good, one kiddo will be heading to an orchestra event. Leaving at 6:45 in the morning. Yippee.

Should be a good week!
