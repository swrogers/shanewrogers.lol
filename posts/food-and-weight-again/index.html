<p>I know that I have previously written on my struggle to work on maintaining my weight, as well as some of the body and confidence issues that go along with that.</p>
<p>We shall count today's journal entry as yet another one of those.</p>
<p>Within the next two months, August 8th I believe, will the the fifth year milestone of living a keto lifestyle.</p>
<p>Before that, I remember sitting in my office chair and watching these amazing transformation videos of people. It always felt a little hypocritical of myself when I did this. There I sat, three hundred thirty plus pounds, knowing that I would never be able to be one of those with a success story of my own.</p>
<p>Within weeks of starting keto, I knew that I wanted nothing more than to just be down a hundred pounds after one year.</p>
<p>Well, I like to say that I basically turned that whole change into a game: how large of a calorie restriction could I maintain, how close to zero net carbs could I average?</p>
<p>I blew way past that hundred pounds loss within that year and was already very close to my current weight already.</p>
<p>My lowest weight was in the 168 pound ballpark. I'm a six foot two plus guy, and I know for a fact that that was too low. I did not look good.</p>
<p>I have slowly worked back up to low 190s. Insofar as health goes, I know that's perfectly acceptable.</p>
<p>But. Mentally, it is not good enough for me. I want 180s. For my mind, where I'm at is just too close to 200. I don't want to be there again.</p>
<p>So, I know that I dropped the weight (I don't like to say I <em>lost</em> it, because I really don't want to <em>find</em> it again) really quickly. Probably not super healthily either. However, I have managed in many ways to change my relationship with food.</p>
<p>I never really ate my feelings. It was more out of boredom than anything. Now, I really try to enjoy the feeling of looking better and use the extra time to read or work on some other self development process.</p>
<p>If I have missed anything at all during this life change, it's that my hair is no longer thick and composed of ringlets (think Weird Al hair). That's about the only thing I miss. But, it could be age related as well.</p>
<p>Today has been a good day, thus far, when it comes to food. Here's to keeping on.</p>
<p>This is post 5/100 of my #100DaysToOffload posts. You can read the other posts in this series <a href="/tags/100daystooffload">here</a>.</p>
