Ah, the great and powerful Monday.

I actually don't mind Mondays. Sure for some people it's the beginning of the work week (myself included), but it also means a great day of getting stuff done at work with little interruption.

Naturally today we had about an hour long team meeting to discuss projects new/old/upcoming and other leadership tidbits. I don't mind, at least it wasn't a 3pm (4pm!) meeting on a Friday. Those stink.

In household news, the granddaughter is starting to feel more and more comfortable. She does get a little upset and sad when her Dad leaves the room or goes to work, but it passes much quicker now than it used to. She's a whole lot happier and just seems to be in a better mood overall now. It's great to see.

Today we also found out what the final cost of repairs are going to be on the vehicle. Shockingly not as bad as I was anticipating, but then I did have a worse case scenario in my head, just so I could be relieved if that was not the case. It still hurts and is money out the door and straight into the incinerator, but it could have been about a thousand dollars worse.

Now all we need is for a major appliance to vomit all over itself and call it a day.

I'm thinking it's about time to get some dinner prepped, so off to do that I go.
