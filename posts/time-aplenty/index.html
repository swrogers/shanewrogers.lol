<p>What a week!</p>
<p>Last week was quite a ride. The weekend hasn't been much different.</p>
<p>I look through a few job listings, not only for my spouse but - potentially - for myself as well.</p>
<p>Again, not that I'm looking to replace my current job, but perhaps more to supplement what I do have.</p>
<p>As far as the spouse goes, well, sometimes I feel like I'm kind of limited. She is great with children and youths, not so much with peers.</p>
<p>It's her perfectionism and drive to do things by the book. Which, in and of itself is not so much a bad thing.</p>
<p>However, when you are around a new group of coworkers who have been doing things the same way for <em>years</em>, well, then that can be a little dicey.</p>
<p>It's not always good to be that squeaky wheel. It gets greased, or it gets replaced.</p>
<p>Not to mention the fact that fitting I to a new clique can be extraordinarily difficult.</p>
<p>Another thing that makes things challenging is that I'm not the most patient teacher, I think. Especially when it comes to how basic computer applications work. I do understand that I should do better here, do more teaching rather than taking over and doing.</p>
<p>There are a lot of jobs out there these days that require basic skills - not to mention even getting an application submitted. I get frustrated far too easily, sometimes.</p>
<p>No matter what she does, though, I completely will be here to support.</p>
<p>All things said, even hobbies can make some extra money. There have been plenty of ideas in this home, plenty of supplies have been purchased, now there is also an abundance of time.</p>
<p>This is post 11/100 of my #100DaysToOffload posts. You can read the other posts in this series <a href="/tags/100daystooffload">here</a>.</p>
