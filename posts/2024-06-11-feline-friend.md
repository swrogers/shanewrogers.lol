Let me begin today by first stating that I love our cat. 

I'm a cat person, more than any other animal. Please note that I stated "I'm a cat person" and not "I'm a pet person".

Over the years I've come to the conclusion that I much prefer *other people's pets* to having my own. 

It's just so, so much easier. And cheaper. Don't want to forget cheaper.

All right, now that that's out of the way. Again, I really love our cat. He's a big ol' gray and white beast that would rather just leave you alone so much as look at you. Which is totally cool with me.

I don't have to worry about him getting around my work area or laying on my laptop. I don't, generally, have to worry about him being underfoot. With the general exception of him racing me downstairs in a vain attempt to trip me.

Of course life isn't all gumdrops and lollypops with the cantankerous cat around. No sir.

He's an indoor cat. If it's one thing that I like even less than pets it's fleas. Most likely because fleas *really* love me. So what's the one thing in all the world that this animal desires?

Yep. Uh huh. He absolutely desires to go outside. Even just the garage. And good golly gee whiz is he **uber, super** vocal about it.

I'd swear, listening to this bad boy **meowrl** just could drive me insane. Dude is loud. Like, if I didn't know better we'd swear he was a she and not neutered (he is).

It's a near constant ordeal, some days.

Have I told you I love my cat?
