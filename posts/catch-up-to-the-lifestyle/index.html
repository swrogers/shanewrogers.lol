<p>We seem to be nearing the midway point of the month. I am just getting back to work from a week of &quot;vacation&quot;, then two days of having a sick kiddo at home. Okay, so three days, really, but today has been more of a &quot;letting the kiddo keep his temp normal&quot; kinda day. Not so much sick, as he is stopped up. At least the cough is more or less done.</p>
<p>As is the way of things, after taking a week off of work today has basically been spent playing catch-up. At least it hasn't been as bad as it's been in the past. Just a couple of quick answers that needed to be sent out. I'm so glad this is a slower time of year. I've generally taken two weeks off at a time, but figured I'd change things up this go round. Of course, what with the sick kiddo I was beginning to wonder if I might have wound up taking this week off as sick leave too.</p>
<h3 id="the-lifestyle">The lifestyle</h3>
<p>How about an update on my keto life? My weight has been steadily creeping up over that 190 plus mark over the past few months. Certainly not where I want to be, no matter what other people in my life think. While I do agree that sub 170 is not a good look on me, I continue to struggle with making my way down below 190. I still have my goal at 182, preferably.</p>
<p>I do consider myself lucky (accomplished?) in that I still wear the same sized jeans and clothes, so I haven't had to change or modify the wardrobe again. Thankfully. That's one of my major fears, that whole idea of relapse, once I were to allow myself to get comfortable with a weight. When that happens, then I stop logging all food, I start snacking more, I start thinking that eating this little bit of junk is going to be okay.</p>
<p>Then it's just a completely blown day and I wanna retreat within myself. I need to be able to string together a few good days.</p>
<p>I need this win, again.</p>
