<p>The first day of school for the kiddos is in the bag!</p>
<p>Everything would seem to have gone nice and smooth, although it's not that much is actually done during the first day.</p>
<p>I have to consider the fact that all of the kids really enjoy school, which does make things so much easier.</p>
<p>Granted, the majority of them are teenagers (more or less) so all is not peachy and rosy. Sometimes just getting the older ones up and about can be quite the chore.</p>
<p>But, I will most certainly take that little inconvenience over having a house full of kids that want nothing to do with school.</p>
<p>Blessings counted and duly noted.</p>

<p>Today has been kind of a day to dread for me. Two meetings that center around a project that has my anxiety levels beyond maxed out.</p>
<p>We are moving from one &quot;top tier, best in class&quot; system (brought to you by Atlassian) to another....which isn't quite as user friendly.</p>
<p>For both service desk (help desk ticketing) and project management.</p>
<p>The help desk side is fine. Whatever.</p>
<p>The project side. Could use a bit of <em>TLC</em>.</p>
<p>It's going to require a bit of a rethink in the way we use the software.</p>
<p>But, even the contact that we were able to work with today realizes and concedes some of the shortcomings.</p>
<p>How fantastically refreshing.</p>
<p>Still, it's not gonna alleviate a lot of the pushback from staff that I'm anticipating.</p>
<p>Still not looking forward to it.</p>
<p>This is post 28/100 of my #100DaysToOffload posts. You can read the other posts in this series <a href="/tags/100daystooffload">here</a>.</p>
