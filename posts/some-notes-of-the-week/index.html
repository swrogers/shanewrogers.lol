<p>So there are times that I think that, perhaps, I should just do week-style notes like some other people do.</p>
<p>Nah, I think that would be far too much pressure on me. Ha.</p>
<p>I think I'll just continue to write on whatever sounds good at the time as a somewhat historical log of my life and times and whatever else is going on around me.</p>
<p>Last weekend we headed down to the Southeast part of the State where I grew up. I hail from Galena Kansas. It's an old mining town, lead infested, seriously poor. Honestly, about what one would expect from a predominately &quot;red&quot; state.</p>
<p>It's always challenging and difficult to go back there and I think that's why I don't make that pilgramage any more than every handful of years or so. I'd love to be able to see my friends more often back that way, but we've all got families and things going on to make our lives extremely busy which makes getting together tough.</p>
<p>We were able to at least meet up for some lunch at a little place called <a href="https://www.latinfusionjoplin.com/home">Latin Fusion</a> that was pretty good. Talked about work and kids and geek stuff for a couple of hours - it was a good time to do some catch up.</p>
<p>Of course we did spend a little time at my Dad's place. The whole reason for heading down that way was for the grandkids to meet granddad. While it would be nice to spend more time with him, my Dad is kind of set in his ways (to put it kindly). We don't always see eye to eye on some things, so we try not to broach certain subjects. I'll leave it as an exercise to the reader to figure out what those might actually be. When some of those ideas did start to come up - it was time to get ready to head out.</p>
<p>Fortunately, by that time, it really was about time to hit the road for the three hour trip if we wanted to miss traffic.</p>
<p>On the way down we took the Missouri side. We came back to Lawrence on the Kansas side. I had wanted to show my family some of the other areas that I grew up, so that was the perfect opportunity. We drove through mainstreet Galena, not much to see there, but it does actually look nicer than it used to. Still a dieing town though.</p>
<p>Then it was through the old neighborhood in Riverton where the early years of my life were spent. That old place is...there really are no words for how run down that old home is. Growing up we had a chainlink fence, at some point it was replaced with a wooden fence. Which has never, ever, been maintained. One Christmas we got a Douglas Fir that was decorated and used as our tree, afterwards we planted it just outside my bedroom window. It was super cool to me, but was removed by somebody who purchased the home after we moved. I hate to see the disrepair of the place.</p>
<p>On the bright side, I picked up a physical copy of the <em>Lunar Remastered</em> edition on Xbox. I've got copies of them (Lunar and Lunar 2 - Eternal Blue) on Sega CD. Too bad I no longer have my Sega CD. Or Genesis. Or 32X. Or Super Nintendo. Or Neo Geo AES (2 joystick edition). I could cry.</p>
<p>Needless to say I've also added the remastered version to my Steam Wishlist and will pick up another copy of it when a sale hits. Because reasons.</p>
<p>Why can't I save money again?</p>
