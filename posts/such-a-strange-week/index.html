<p>It has been such a long, unusually strange week.</p>
<p>Let us take yesterday, as an example: it was a Friday, but it didn't feel like a Friday. Nor did it feel like a Saturday. Or a Sunday. I don't know what day of thee week it felt like, it just seemed off.</p>
<p>I would imagine that having odd number of kiddos home probably had something to do with it. Parent teacher conferences make for a short week of school. The majority of them only had a three day week. The one oddity being the kiddo in advanced math having to take his class on Thursday at the high school. Then they were all home on Friday, which is super exciting.</p>
<p>Insofar as work goes for me, I assisted with a presentation and facilitation of a question and answer session for the new ticketing tool that we've been on for a month or so.</p>
<p>That actually went pretty well.</p>
<p>Documentation has been added to for the department. I think that is one of my favorite things to do, if I'm being honest. I try to keep good instructions for not only future me, but for my users as well. We've got a pretty decent wiki application for that. Of course I still wind up just exporting stuff out to PDF, but it is what it is.</p>
<p>I have jumped back into trying to learn Angular once again. The previous attempt was back in 2020 and I almost made it all the way through the course that I was taking. I've got a handful of them, two of them are pretty highly recommended. I would say that I'd like to get some kind of webdev position, but I think realistically I love what I do far too much to go that route.</p>
<p>Of course, I also like to dabble in Clojure, so yeah.</p>
<p>I feel that I'm kind of akin to the hyperactive pet who sees one shiny thing after another and just can't keep his mind on one thing at a time. I get bored easily I suppose.</p>
<p>Then I'm also currently staring at a hard copy of <em>Django 5 By Example</em>. Ugh. I've liked django since before they went through the magic removal stuff. Way, way back in the day at this point. I'd even built a blog that contained a reading list that pulled info from a certain well known book selling website to keep my reading list in. I was kind of proud of that.</p>
<p>Ah well.</p>
<p>Not much going on today - we'll make a store run and take the little one to birthday party. Should be fun!</p>
