<p>Aye, and on the seventh day yet another post has appeared! We are coming up on the end of another school year for our kids, another year that continues to speed on past us. The next few weeks are going to be very full of events. Along with the full schedules, comes special types of stress.</p>
<p>Stress. Along with most people, I would imagine, I am not a fan. Some people stress eat, thankfully I am not one of those. I eat out of boredom. At least this is something that I am aware of. I've been trying to eat better for a handful of years now, some would say successfully. My wife and myself opted to go the ketogenic journey and I have kept a out 145 pounds off my frame for some time now. Three thirty plus to one eighty five, give or take.</p>
<p>Okay, so where am I going in all of this rambling? As I get older, as I watch my kids grow into greater ages, I made a decision that I wanted to see them get older. I knew that if I had continued on in the direction that I was going, that I'd be in a grave within very little time. I have no doubt that I have avoided diabetes and at least taken one foot off of the banana peel, so to speak. Not to mention feeling much better and, hopefully, modeling a healthier behavior for my children.</p>
<p>No rest for myself on this day, though. The second day of my vacation and I've done little to nothing that I would like to get done. Ah, but then who really wants to do pre-spring cleaning on their vacations.</p>
