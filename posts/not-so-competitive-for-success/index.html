<p>There are a couple of things that I've recently realized about myself.</p>
<p>One of them is something that I'm absolutely terrified about.</p>
<p>Another is just a quirk, an interesting tidbit about me that I hadn't fully recognize before.</p>
<p>First - in some ways success terrifies me.</p>
<p>Second - while I'm about the least competitive person that I know, I'm always extremely competitive against (with?) myself.</p>
<h3 id="item-the-first">Item the first</h3>
<p>I'm sure that I'm not the only person out there that is terrified of something turning out to be successful. Whatever that something might be.</p>
<p>Whether it's putting myself out there when looking for employment, for example, I have that fear not of <em>what if I get denied</em> but of <em>what if I get approved?</em></p>
<p>Then there are social situations. This might, or might not, have just as much to do with being introverted as well, though.</p>
<p>Let us say that I were to go looking for some kind of connection. Platonic or otherwise, it makes no matter. Frankly, I'm terrible at small talk. I've been told that I'm a competent communicator, but that's not necessarily for me to decide.</p>
<p>I don't know how to make friends any more. It's tough.</p>
<h3 id="item-the-second">Item the second</h3>
<p>I have never been competitive.</p>
<p>Ever.</p>
<p>I was basically forced into playing team sports when I was a kid (granted, T-ball was fun - ha). Baseball. Basketball. Football.</p>
<p>I could actually pitch with either left or right handed. Couldn't do it now to save my life, but it was a thing I was capable of.</p>
<p>I never liked any of it though.</p>
<p>Probably didn't help that all of the teams I was on stunk. But that's not relevant.</p>
<p>I was able to come to the conclusion the other day that the only person I compete with, in any way, is myself.</p>
<p>And it does not allow me to relax. Ever.</p>
<p>Take keto, for example. When we started on keto five years ago I dove into the deep end. Got an app and basically <em>gamed the heck out of it</em>. I would try to see just how few carbs I could do compared to all the other users of the app. Routinely I fell into the top tier and could easily go less than 5 to 7 net carbs a day. Logging everything.</p>
<p>I would go to sleep at night super stoked to get up in morning to see how much weight has fallen off. Quite often it would be a pound or so.</p>
<p>Was it safe? Not really. But it was my addiction, that self competition.</p>
<p>Another example would be when I take my noon walks.</p>
<p>I would imagine that when most people take walks it helps to clear their minds for the time ahead.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's not how my head works.</p>
<p>My oh my how I wish it did.</p>
<p>Nope, I have this constant beat that runs through my mind: <em>one, two, three, four, one, two...</em> On and on and on.</p>
<p>I have the need to push myself, quicker and quicker. Finish strong! I tell myself.</p>
<p>I matters not if I've got music in my ears or listening to an NPR podcast. Same story.</p>
<p>Why can't I just relax?</p>
