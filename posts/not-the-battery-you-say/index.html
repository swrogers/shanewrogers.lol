<p>This morning, the vehicle was taken into the local big box retailer that also happens to have a tire and lube department. Supposedly they can also check batteries, but honestly I don't know how much I'd trust them to even unlock a vehicle if you handed them the keys and a YouTube video with instructions.</p>
<p>This is coming from a person who used to be a salary manager at this store. So, yeah, when you've worked there and seen that the department has had to replace two engines because reasons - you lose what little faith there was.</p>
<p>Where was I? Oh, yes, the vehicle was taken into this store to get the battery checked and maybe replaced. Evidently, they checked the battery and it was fine. I guess.</p>
<p>I don't know, though. The car is over 36 months old, so in my opinion I think we should replace the thing. It's spendy, but I'd rather not get stranded. I suppose that I'll just keep the mobile jumper in it. Charged.</p>
<p>The spouse drove it around to her appointments today as well and has said that it did not act up. I would like to follow through with some plans we had for this weekend and go to the local amusement park - but I've got trust issues.</p>
<p>I have been known to basically be done with my car at the onset of issues. Seems bad, but, it is what it is.</p>
<h3 id="other-stuff">Other Stuff</h3>
<p>We've been watching <a href="https://m.imdb.com/title/tt12637874/">Fallout</a> over the past week. Not too bad, certainly looking forward to seeing where it goes.</p>
<p>I don't know what we'll watch next, but it's not for lack of content.</p>
<p>Kingdom Hearts came out on Steam. I had not intended on buying the bundle...but I bought the bundle. Of course.</p>
<p>While I really do think that I like my blogging set up and workflow here, the tinkerer in me just can't leave well enough alone. I've set up a small digitalocean droplet and installed <a href="https://withknown.com/">Known</a> once again. I like it, but I'm just not sure that I <em>love</em> it. I'll probably stick with what I've got.</p>
<p>It's hard to beat flat text files and markdown.</p>
