It has been a couple of uneventful days, which if I'm being honest is not such a bad thing.

Work has been moving along at a nice steady pace, with some progress being made on the good old Team Dynamix front. 

On that, I shall say that my enthusiasm has been ever so tempered at this point. There does not seem to be a path forward for our department to be able to have the type of control that we would like, nor some of the project management features that some would hope for. 

We shall, however, make due.

Next week will be an off week for me. Yet another week of vacation.

Most people would be super stoked and excited about that, I'm sure, but if you're a reader of my past posts you might know that I'm not a fan.

However, my wife also has next week off - so maybe we can get out and hit a local park or something with the kids. Take advantage of those uber expensive passes we have.

What we really should do, though, is work on getting our extra bedroom set back up for the eldest kiddo. Along with the rest of the home. We are considering getting licensed by the State for an in-home childcare center. To do that will require a little bit of setup but totally worth it.

Of course, I know for a fact what we'll *actually* do next week. Absolutely nothing. Apart from doing stuff with the kids for the Fourth of July.

Here's to a good rest of the week.
