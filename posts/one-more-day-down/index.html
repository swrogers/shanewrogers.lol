<p>It's certainly been a day.</p>
<p>And night, honestly. Late last night our eldest came home with his little one. I will say that it wasn't entirely unexpected, and that we as a family are glad to have them here. We are grateful that we are <em>able</em> to have them here. This weekend will be a bit of work, as I have kinda taken over the extra room and made an office out of it, which will have to be swapped back over to make room for the two of them.</p>
<p>We've also got a couple of us in the home who aren't exactly feeling all that well. One probably should have come home early with an ear infection/headache/head cold. Myself, I'm halfway stopped up with a scratchy throat and can't sleep worth a darn. It's been a pretty not so fun time overall here in the household.</p>
<p>The twins have the last day of school tomorrow, assuming that they are both able to go. Next year they will be finishing up middle school.</p>
<p>Right now, I'm just sitting here, listening to the quiet that is octonaughts. Who are also asking for peace and quiet. It's kinda meta.</p>
<p>Wanna read my other <a href="/tags/weblogpomo2024">#weblogpomo2024</a> posts?</p>
