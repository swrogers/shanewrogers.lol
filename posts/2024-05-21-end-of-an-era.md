Today was the recognition ceremony for our fifth grader. This is certainly a special class, one that we feel honored to have gotten to be involved with. Our fellow parents are amazing, our son's peer group is just flat out phenomenal, we couldn't ask for anything better.

This class has marked a couple of milestones. First, the school principal started out with this group in kindergarten. She's been a wonderful person - an advocate above all who believes in all the students. Sadly for this school, she is leaving for another district.

Second, our young man has had a gifted IEP for a number of years now (recall what I said about the principal being an advocate?), and he was the first gifted student for his particular gifted facilitator. She, too, has been a joy to work with. We have had nothing but positive memories for this school and the people there.

Fortunately, we still have one more kiddo to take through this journey. He is getting to go through this school's beginning of a Montessori program. So far, it's been good for him. We would have loved to have had more of them go through this type of learning system, but at least one is able to.

When we first moved here, I admit to having doubts about this area and this school - but no longer.
