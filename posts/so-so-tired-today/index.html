<p>It's been a day of feeling absolutely miserable. Took a couple of benadryl may night, with the hope being that I might be able to some decent sleep to go along with being stopped up with a sore throat.</p>
<p>Yeah, that didn't work too well. While I was basically falling asleep at 22:00 last night, I also managed to forget to put the recycling and trash out for the morning. At least I was able to get them out this morning. The problem with benadryl is that it takes forever to wear out of my system.</p>
<p>So even right now, at 1700 the next day, I feel like I could go to bed.</p>
<p>Sigh.</p>
<p>At least the grand daughter wasn't too bad today! She doesn't really know us, but we've been working on that and I think that we are making progress.</p>
<p>Anyhow, here's a photo I took of our backyard swing while I was pushing our six year old on it. Enjoy. 😃</p>
