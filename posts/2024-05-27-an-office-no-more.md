The long weekend is nearly at an end. I didn't get nearly as much done as I wanted. Color me all kinds of surprised. Did manage to get the lawn mowed and the AC fan unit hosed off, so there is that.

What I had really wanted to do, get the office/extra room cleared out for the eldest and the grand, didn't happen quite as planned. We need to get room cleared out in some other places first. Namely the master bedroom. My workspace is once again going to be the corner of the bedroom. I don't actually mind, I think it's more than worth it to have our eldest and his kiddo in a better situation. It's going to make things interesting around here for awhile, no doubt about it.
