Well we are evidently in an actua *Blizzard Warning* now.

Yippee!

I attempted earlier this evening, just after dinner, to go out and grab some stuff from the store. Milk and whatever. 

I had, earlier this afternoon, salted the walk and driveway. I guess I should have salted just a bit more in some areas, since I took a decent header going to the car. 

Made it about half a block down, slip sliding all the while, until I decided that nobody needed milk that badly. Backed up and headed back home.

Gone maybe 5 minutes, including scraping ice off the windows. 

Now, I've got a ginormous welt on the side of my left leg.

It's sore, but livable. Certainly huge though.

Woot.
