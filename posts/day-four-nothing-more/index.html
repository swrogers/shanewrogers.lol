<p>Here we are at day for during this monthly challenge. The next couple of days are going to be the first two that present as very difficult for me - will I be able to get something posted during the weekend, while the home is filled with family and kids and I would rather <em>not</em> be dealing with a computer.<p>So in that case, I am not using a computer or laptop for the post. Instead I'm seeing how well the <a href=https://gitjournal.io/ >GitJournal</a> app works on my phone. I don't really have any other content management system set up here, so this really needs to work.<p>Maybe this would be a good excuse to set up a Ghost CMS for the front end. Probably not, though.<p>I've done no reading today, so that's a negative. I did check out the Samurai Jack series from the local library, I'm looking forward to giving that a watch!<p>With that....till next time.<p>Check out the other <a href=/tags/weblogpomo2024>#Weblogpomo2024</a> posts.
