<p>Not much of an interesting week, this one.</p>
<p>I've been meaning to try to get something down and posted but it's been a week of zero motivation.</p>
<p>I haven't even mowed the lawn in two weekends at this point. Fortunately I don't think I <em>need</em> to mow yet, but I probably will before the season is out.</p>
<p>One of the twins was able to participate in the first cross country event this season and he did pretty well! I would like to be able to run with him, but I'm not there yet.</p>
<p>I still try to take my lunch hour excursions and walk. Generally I can get in just under three miles in about forty minutes. Then a quick shower before logging back in to work.</p>
<p>My goal still remains to run a 5K. I'm sure I'll get there.</p>
<p>I had ordered the <em>Run Your Own Mail Server</em> book, by Michael W Lewis, towards the end of the pre-order period and it finally arrived this week! I've run mail servers for myself in the past, generally through systems like <a href="https://mailinabox.email/">mail on a box</a> or <a href="https://yunohost.org/">yunonost</a>. I think even at one point I had set up <a href="http://www.qmailtoaster.net/">qmail toaster</a>.</p>
<p>But it's nice to know more about the what's and the why's, and it looks like this most excellent book is going to help out in that department. I don't know that I'll set something up from scratch... But that is certainly an itch.</p>

It's always entertaining to read about who mysterious anonymous posters might be, even if there is no real need or desire to dox anyone. I haven't made it through everything in this, but it's about a user in one of the math boards who always manages to post responses to some very challenging integration problems. Are they a team? Are they using multiple accounts? Who knows.</p>

I've been looking more into learning go, so it's nice to have more stuff to learn from.</p>

<p>That's all I've got for now, until time the next all!
