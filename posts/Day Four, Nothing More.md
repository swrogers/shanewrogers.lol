Here we are at day for during this monthly challenge. The next couple of days are going to be the first two that present as very difficult for me - will I be able to get something posted during the weekend, while the home is filled with family and kids and I would rather *not* be dealing with a computer.

So in that case, I am not using a computer or laptop for the post. Instead I'm seeing how well the [GitJournal](https://gitjournal.io/) app works on my phone. I don't really have any other content management system set up here, so this really needs to work.

Maybe this would be a good excuse to set up a Ghost CMS for the front end. Probably not, though.

I've done no reading today, so that's a negative. I did check out the Samurai Jack series from the local library, I'm looking forward to giving that a watch!

With that....till next time.
