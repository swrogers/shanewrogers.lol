Happy long weekend all!

I guess. 

I can't really relax, I have this constant feeling today that I need to be doing something. Anything.

It's not like I've been lazy today, either. Woke up, made my mug of coffee. Cleaned out the floor of our "soon to be coat" closet. Emptied the dishwasher. Filled the dishwasher. Ran the dishwasher. Took my first sip of coffee.

Still there are so many things that need to be done. Or, that I feel should be done.

I should mow the lawn, for example. 

I can't get motivated today.

### The weekend 
We had a pretty decent weekend I guess.

Saturday was a birthday party for the daughter of a friend. Our little man enjoys going over there, so it was a good time.

Sunday was the penultimate day for the local water park to be open this year, so we went out that direction. I didn't go there as I'm not as big a fan, but the wife and the little did go and seemed to enjoy the day.

Myself and the eldest twin went to the amusement park side. It was really pretty good, not too hot, not too many people. We were able to get in half a dozen rides in - mostly coasters - within a handful of hours.

Any time you don't have to spend three hours in a single line is a good day. 

Afterwards, we met up and had dinner in the the amusement park so the little guy could ride some stuff too. 

Then the adults got to eat. 

It was a successful trip, all in all.

We'll be back in a couple of weeks for the halloween haunts they set up. Those are great!
