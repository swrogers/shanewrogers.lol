This morning, the vehicle was taken into the local big box retailer that also happens to have a tire and lube department. Supposedly they can also check batteries, but honestly I don't know how much I'd trust them to even unlock a vehicle if you handed them the keys and a YouTube video with instructions.

This is coming from a person who used to be a salary manager at this store. So, yeah, when you've worked there and seen that the department has had to replace two engines because reasons - you lose what little faith there was.

Where was I? Oh, yes, the vehicle was taken into this store to get the battery checked and maybe replaced. Evidently, they checked the battery and it was fine. I guess.

I don't know, though. The car is over 36 months old, so in my opinion I think we should replace the thing. It's spendy, but I'd rather not get stranded. I suppose that I'll just keep the mobile jumper in it. Charged. 

The spouse drove it around to her appointments today as well and has said that it did not act up. I would like to follow through with some plans we had for this weekend and go to the local amusement park - but I've got trust issues.

I have been known to basically be done with my car at the onset of issues. Seems bad, but, it is what it is.

### Other Stuff
We've been watching [Fallout](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt12637874/) over the past week. Not too bad, certainly looking forward to seeing where it goes.

I don't know what we'll watch next, but it's not for lack of content.

Kingdom Hearts came out on Steam. I had not intended on buying the bundle...but I bought the bundle. Of course.

While I really do think that I like my blogging set up and workflow here, the tinkerer in me just can't leave well enough alone. I've set up a small digitalocean droplet and installed [Known](https://withknown.com/) once again. I like it, but I'm just not sure that I *love* it. I'll probably stick with what I've got.

It's hard to beat flat text files and markdown.
