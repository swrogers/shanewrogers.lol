Good grief have I been cutting it close these past couple of days! I wound up taking the day off with a migraine and sore throat. Plus the salt in the wound that is the pink eye, which is being treated successfully.

I also got the opportunity to watch the grand today, for whatever that was worth as she wasn't feeling the best either, what with it being a new environment and not having her dad at home. It's going to take a bit for her to get used to us, but kids are very adaptable.

Still wasn't able to make any progress on their future room, though. Not sure how well tomorrow will go in that regard either. It does make me feel kinda horrible.

Ah well, on to the latest episode of *Dark Matter*.
