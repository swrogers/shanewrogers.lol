I did not post anything yesterday. 

After over a month of managing to get something put up, I skipped a day. 

And you know what? That's okay. 

It's not a habit until it becomes something more normal. I hope that days like yesterday are more the exception than the rule. 

There was some productivity that was had yesterday, despite the overnight rain I was able to get the lawn mowed and some other weeds taken care of. We've got an older Snapper battery operated lawnmower, and I consider it a major accomplishment if I'm able to get the lawn mowed within a single 4Ah battery. If I can get it weekly, it's usually possible, and only takes about an hour.

Still, I really need to run the weed eater though.

The second vehicle is still at the dealership, hopefully it's finished by Monday afternoon. It really stinks not having my car. Not that I go anywhere, or that I could go anywhere at this time. But still.

I've got a question into our insurance agent, wondering about a few things that are related about that vehicle issue, but I'm not overly optimistic about any responses there. Certainly nothing favorable, anyway.

It's getting close to that time to begin thinking about birthday gifts for the spouse. Sometimes I'm just not really in a gift giving mood, and this seems to be one of those times. I do, however, think I know what I'm going to get, so that's positive.

### Last Week's Links
I think I'm going to start something new here, too, this week. In something of an effort to reduce the number of open tabs that I have on my phone, I'm going to add to a listing of links that I've found of interest.

- [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/) an older single file wiki based, server less, personal knowledge base application. I haven't used this in forever, it's good to see it's still kicking though.
- [How to install and configure hubzilla](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/how-to-install-and-configure-hubzilla/) I like the idea of Hubzilla, and I also like the idea of running my own fediverse something or other. I already have plenty of them, though, and don't need to *collect them all* in this case.
- [Ente Auth](https://news.itsfoss.com/ente-auth/) I really need to get away from Google Authenticator, since it kinda stinks. You'd think that Google would at least provide some kind of *search* for theirs, but.... That's asking quite a lot. Ente seems pretty cool, they've also got a photos replacement.
- [Cara](https://cara.app/home) Something of an Instagram replacement that has had really good growth over the last few weeks from what I see. They have really strong safeguards and stances on AI.
