Well, it's after 1500 so I guess that is should probably work on getting *something* written up. 

It's also a long weekend here, normally that would be a good thing, but once again I just struggle to enjoy all the free time. What doesn't help this go round is that I get to play the bad guy in the house. Some people in the home want an animal, specifically a dog. I don't have anything against dogs, so long as they aren't mine. 

I've come to the conclusion that I'm not a pet person. I much prefer other people's pets. I know that if we get a dog, the person that winds up taking care of it 80 percent of the time or more, will be the person writing this entry. I don't want a dog. This makes me feel like an asshole. It is what it is.

I have a hard enough time keeping care of the cat and two bearded dragons that are in the home. Our walls are scratched and destroyed - at some point in time I'd like to get those taken care of. The yard looks like ass right now, I don't want it to get worse nor do I relish the thought of scooping poop. We tried having a dog already. He ate part of the couch, some books, a couple of apple trees, a peach tree, a cherry tree and a fig tree. Yeah. I don't want a dog.

I'd almost consider going back into the office to work before that.

Well, that turned into a thing.
