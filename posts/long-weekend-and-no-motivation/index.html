<p>Happy long weekend all!</p>
<p>I guess.</p>
<p>I can't really relax, I have this constant feeling today that I need to be doing something. Anything.</p>
<p>It's not like I've been lazy today, either. Woke up, made my mug of coffee. Cleaned out the floor of our &quot;soon to be coat&quot; closet. Emptied the dishwasher. Filled the dishwasher. Ran the dishwasher. Took my first sip of coffee.</p>
<p>Still there are so many things that need to be done. Or, that I feel should be done.</p>
<p>I should mow the lawn, for example.</p>
<p>I can't get motivated today.</p>
<h3 id="the-weekend">The weekend</h3>
<p>We had a pretty decent weekend I guess.</p>
<p>Saturday was a birthday party for the daughter of a friend. Our little man enjoys going over there, so it was a good time.</p>
<p>Sunday was the penultimate day for the local water park to be open this year, so we went out that direction. I didn't go there as I'm not as big a fan, but the wife and the little did go and seemed to enjoy the day.</p>
<p>Myself and the eldest twin went to the amusement park side. It was really pretty good, not too hot, not too many people. We were able to get in half a dozen rides in - mostly coasters - within a handful of hours.</p>
<p>Any time you don't have to spend three hours in a single line is a good day.</p>
<p>Afterwards, we met up and had dinner in the the amusement park so the little guy could ride some stuff too.</p>
<p>Then the adults got to eat.</p>
<p>It was a successful trip, all in all.</p>
<p>We'll be back in a couple of weeks for the halloween haunts they set up. Those are great!</p>
