Not much of an interesting week, this one. 

I've been meaning to try to get something down and posted but it's been a week of zero motivation. 

I haven't even mowed the lawn in two weekends at this point. Fortunately I don't think I *need* to mow yet, but I probably will before the season is out.

One of the twins was able to participate in the first cross country event this season and he did pretty well! I would like to be able to run with him, but I'm not there yet. 

I still try to take my lunch hour excursions and walk. Generally I can get in just under three miles in about forty minutes. Then a quick shower before logging back in to work. 

My goal still remains to run a 5K. I'm sure I'll get there.

I had ordered the *Run Your Own Mail Server* book, by Michael W Lewis, towards the end of the pre-order period and it finally arrived this week! I've run mail servers for myself in the past, generally through systems like [mail on a box](https://mailinabox.email/) or [yunonost](https://yunohost.org/). I think even at one point I had set up [qmail toaster](http://www.qmailtoaster.net/).

But it's nice to know more about the what's and the why's, and it looks like this most excellent book is going to help out in that department. I don't know that I'll set something up from scratch... But that is certainly an itch.

I have not read this one yet, but it's certainly high on my list.

It's always entertaining to read about who mysterious anonymous posters might be, even if there is no real need or desire to dox anyone. I haven't made it through everything in this, but it's about a user in one of the math boards who always manages to post responses to some very challenging integration problems. Are they a team? Are they using multiple accounts? Who knows.

I've been looking more into learning go, so it's nice to have more stuff to learn from.

That's all I've got for now, until time the next all!
