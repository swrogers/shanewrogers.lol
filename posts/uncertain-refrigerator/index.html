<p>If it isn't one thing it's about seventy three others with our luck.</p>
<p>When we moved into our home over nine years ago we had to pick up a few appliances. A refrigerator, washer and dryer, we also procured a stand up freezer for the garage.</p>
<p>The house came with dishwasher, range and microwave.</p>
<p>After tomorrow, only two (!) of those items will remain as original.</p>
<p>The warranty on our fridge, an LG, ran out after 5 years had passed. We just <em>barely</em> squeaked in a warranty covered repair to the compressor on it, mere months before the expiration.</p>
<p>The washer and dryer unit that we originally bought, well, that I originally picked out because of cost (either Maytag or Whirlpool, I don't recall at this point) have been replaced. Twice. (The original units, believe it or not, <em>did not have a clean out for the washer</em>....so eventually when all the kids socks get sucked in, you can't easily access them to clear them out.)</p>
<p>Two Novembers ago, maybe three, the range died. It's been replaced.</p>
<p>Now... After sitting with an error code that has not allowed the external panel to work for a couple years, nor the external water and ice maker (yeah, horrible, sigh...it's tough to find them without ice) to work, the fridge has finally decided that it's the end of days.</p>
<p>It gets replaced tomorrow.</p>
<p>This stuff is nearly impossible to work on. It's just not the same kind of items that even our parents bought.</p>
<p>Gone are the times when you grew up with the same, oh say....refrigerator...in the home throughout your childhood and young adult years.</p>
<p>Sigh.</p>
<p>Naturally, the assigned delivery window for tomorrow's unit is right smack dab around school pick up time for the kids.</p>
<p>Because, why wouldn't it be.</p>
