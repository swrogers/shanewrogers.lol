<p>Ah, I am once again at the point to where my vacation time is maxed out at work. So it's either use &quot;it or don't gain any more&quot; time.</p>
<p>One thing that I do really enjoy about my coworkers and my manager staff is that they absolutely, positively, expect and <strong>encourage</strong> us to use our time. It is a nice change of pace from those souls who work for people who actively discourage such use.</p>
<p>In my position, we max out at 304 hours of vacation. I accumulate 8 hours every pay period (less two pay periods, where there are three paychecks in a month, I think...). We also accumulate 4 hours of sick leave every check, which does not max out - which is nice. I'm near to 750 hours there.</p>
<p>I don't take a whole lot of time off.</p>
<p>But I have kind of grown accustomed to having every other Friday off. It's pretty sweet.</p>
<p>In some other news, I've been slowly trimming the dead nail off of my right thumb. There is just a small sliver left on the side at this point. I'm just really glad that I haven't caught it on anything and ripped the thing out yet. I don't believe that would be too pleasant.</p>
<p>I don't have much else going on right now. Oh, we did have the youngest kiddos birthday party last weekend, which had an excellent turn out! We paired up with a friend and rented out Up And Away Play for Sunday morning for a couple of hours. It went pretty well, though I'm not sure we'll do the same next time.</p>
<p>Next up we'll have the twins' birthday party, which is set up for an ice cream social slash pizza party slash other stuff at a city community room. It should be fun. They've been inviting a handful of friends, which for one of them is a little out of his comfort zone. Sort of. Although I will say, he had an excellent way to put things: <em>While I may have few people that I would count as friends, because I think there is a difference between friendship and those that I have positive interactions with</em>. I was completely blown away by that when my wife told me that he'd said that. It's just so mature, and I don't even think I'd come up with that one.</p>
<p>I love my kids.</p>
