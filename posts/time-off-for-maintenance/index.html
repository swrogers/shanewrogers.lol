<p>Tis the season, I suppose.</p>
<p>For some car maintenance and time off, that is. Ha!</p>
<p>Oh, and Christmas and New Year's and all that jazzy stuff.</p>
<p>Yesterday was my last day of, um, &quot;work&quot; for the year. There was much really to do except help with a couple of requests, which was totally cool. Had a handful of things that needed wrapped up and it was actually kinda nice to be able to do so.</p>
<p>This morning was up at the standard time - sleeping in?! What the hell is that?? Had to get the car into the shop for some juuuuust barely overdue service (maybe a hundred miles?). Not too bad.</p>
<p>At least the dealership doesn't try too hard to oversell crap.</p>
<p>That done, it was time to go home. Open door, hear the kids argue.</p>
<p>Sigh.</p>
<p>Dammit.</p>
<p>Sometimes I just wish they could solve their own problems. I basically just ignored them this time. Ha.</p>
<p>In some absolutely non related tangents, I've really been trying to come up with a new from scratch emacs config.</p>
<p>Don't ask me why, I don't have any answers at all.</p>
<p>None. Zero. Zilch. Zip. Nada.</p>
<p>I've managed to stick with Doom Emacs for quite some time now and I just keep going back to that. I like it, sure.</p>
<p>There is just part of me that, I don't know, wants to grok the whole dang thing. For some reason.</p>
<p>The problem is, I either keep trying to basically recreate Doom, or I'm just not really certain what packages I want to start with.</p>
<p>I've got all of what is consider the &quot;new standards&quot; covered: vertigo, marginalia, orderless, whatever else goes into that stack.</p>
<p>Then I'm like a stinking dog that chases squirrels all over the woods. It gets exhausting.</p>
<p>Plus, I'm trying to get org more incorporated into my desk life - so there's that. I'd say &quot;life&quot;, but there aren't a whole lot of decent and mature org related apps on Android. Tmux and emacs running within on my phone don't count, in my mind.</p>
<p>I do have Zettel (using it now!), Orgzly Revived and OrgNotes...but....eeh. I want better templates and capture/sharing.</p>
<p>Anyhow.</p>
<p>Take care, you all.</p>
