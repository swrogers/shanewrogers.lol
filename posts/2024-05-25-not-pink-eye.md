As the saying goes, "oh for crying out loud!" Not only have I/we not all been feeling too well, but last night my right eye began bothering me. It felt really dry, not super itchy or anything, just dry and a little hazy at times.

I get up and look into the mirror. 

Whoa, that's certainly a red, rather angry looking eye I've got there.

Now, being a parent of five kiddos, there really is only one thing that goes through my head at this point, and I can't quite figure out how in the world I would have come down with *pink eye*.

Sigh.

Fortunately, we do have five kiddos (well, mostly four, though the first is back under the roof with his own as well now) in the house. Plus, we don't like to throw medication away. Or anything really, but that's another story. So I guess it's eye drops for me.

How I've managed to go all my life without getting this before I'll never know. It's right up there with *how in the world did I get it this time?*

So annoying.
