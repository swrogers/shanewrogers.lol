I think I'm going to try to do something that will be very difficult for me. I've decided to join the group in a *post every day during the month of May* challenge that has been dubbed [#WeblogPoMo2024](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/weblog-posting-month-2024). 

I shall be using the same tag here, [as well](/tags/weblogpomo2024) for sake of categorization. I guess it's likely  that I'll even start using the echo feed account that I've been paying for.

We'll see how this goes. I was able to do the "post a photo every day for 30 days" thing over on microblog to get that badge, which wasn't super easy for me either.
