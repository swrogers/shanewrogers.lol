<p>Back when I was in school, not quite the stone age but it sure seems like it at this point, Summer School was for those students who - how to put this - weren't the best of kids. Or, at least that was the perception.</p>
<p>Maybe it still is, I don't really know.</p>
<p>The reality, our reality anyhow, is that Summer School is for those kiddos who want to get ahead. Those kids and students who want to have just a tad more flexibility in their class choices for the normal school year.</p>
<p>That is <em>exactly</em> what my two Freshmen are doing this month. They wanted to get into some Summer classes so they could take what they wanted during the Fall.</p>
<p>A wise decision that we as parents are absolutely, positively, 100 percent behind!</p>
<p>Today we just got back from picking up a couple of district iPads for them so they can take their &quot;Health and PE&quot; course online through the local Virtual School program. Things didn't go quite as smoothly as one would have liked, considering that we'd received a couple of emails letting us know the time and place for where to pick hardware up.</p>
<p>Naturally, there weren't a whole lot of people who knew what was going on - but, they were able to get us taken care of in great order!</p>
<p>There is not much going on this week, this evening the kiddos have been signed up for some food prep oriented classes at the local library and that starts up right around dinner time. Good thing it's leftover night at the house!</p>
<p>This Friday I need to have some cupcakes made for a birthday party. They're going with Oreo cupcakes. I've made them before and from what I understand they were a pretty big hit. I wouldn't know, since I can't eat them. Meh. We all make our decisions and get to live with the consequences!</p>
