Ah, the *Tale of the Telluride* just will not quit. It's like the gift that keeps on giving.

Not in a good way.

But then, how often are things "good" when **that** particular phrase comes into play. Yeah, not all that often.

So after paying too stonking much for repairs due to a, um, we shall say "self imposed" accident, now it looks like we might have a little bit of salt rubbed into that festering wound. 

You know, for good measure.

While it's probably entirely coincidental, it looks like we'll be replacing the battery in the beast. Twice today when going to start it up we've experienced a series of error checks (ECS, BCW, blah blah blah) and clicks and basically what looks like a computer system spasming out and proverbially vomiting all over itself.

It's great. The vehicle is a 2021, so I guess it's about that time for the OEM battery to go. At least that's the opinion of the interwebs, that they'll last about 2.5 years. I don't mind, really. Having the battery die or running out of gas are about two of the larger vehicle fears that I have.

Hopefully that's what the problem is.
