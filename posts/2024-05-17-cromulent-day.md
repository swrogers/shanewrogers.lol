I feel like I should have more to write about today.

I feel like I could (should?) have been more productive today.

Let us count what all I've accomplished to get done this fine, fine Friday the seventeenth.
- One of our major SaaS applications is going to be upgraded at the end of the month, so that needed to be added to the calendar.
- A group request that I'd made a couple of days ago was just fulfilled, so I was able to make a couple of updates in prep for a background process. Which can't be finished until a separate sync occurs.
- I brought an item to another groups attention, so that the requestor can be thought how to help themselves.
- I've started learning a new service management/issue tracker/asset management/knowledge base system of which I am one of the main admins for our group. This should be fun.
- Trying to pick up some Laravel. I don't know why or for what purpose, seeing as I actually prefer clojure for fun and....well, not really profit seeing as how it's a hobby.

Yeah, that's about the gist of what I've done today. I guess I did upgrade one of my Kimsufi boxes and portainer container. It's been a moderately full day, and for that I'm completely okay!
