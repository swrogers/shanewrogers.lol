<p>Last night my head was killing me.</p>
<p>This morning my head was still killing me. I have to say that I consider myself extremely fortunate to have a very flexible career that affords me the ability to take time when I need it. It is not something that need be done very often - not for myself anyhow - but I'm more than happy to take it.</p>
<p>Currently, I'm sitting in the quiet of the dinning area, watching one of the kiddos make some kind of banana <em>slash</em> chocolate <em>slash</em> puff pastry dessert that he and Mom had seen online somewhere. It looks interesting, and I'm sure it'll be tasty for them.</p>
<p>Did I mention that this kiddo is only just out of fifth grade? He's been baking and cooking for what seems like a couple of years now. The kiddo is very driven and fairly well rounded.</p>
<p>Normally, anyhow. Sometimes these kids will surprise with some of those &quot;You asked what?!&quot; questions. They are all super intelligent, have gifted IEPs in school, but still - on occasion - they show their age and remind us that they are still children, and need guidance to make their way.</p>
<p>And that is perfectly fine. It's what we are here for.</p>
<p>This is post 2/100 of my #100DaysToOffload posts. You can read the other posts in this series <a href="/tags/100daystooffload">here</a>.</p>
