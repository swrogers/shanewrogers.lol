If I were to be honest - and really why wouldn't I be so - today has been something of a productive day. I don't feel like I have a whole lot of *actual product* that came out of today, but I do feel that I made some learning progress today for work. 

That, my friends, is certainly positive. I'm learning some working details of our new ticketing/asset/configuration item/project system. We're moving from the atlassian product, so it's something along those lines. I don't mind jira, but it'll be nice to not have different login system and be able to use our single sign on. Plus, while I will be a department admin, I don't have to admin the whole thing.

Today was also the last day of school for the kindergartner and the fifth grader. It's bittersweet all around. 

Yeah, it's a short update day.
