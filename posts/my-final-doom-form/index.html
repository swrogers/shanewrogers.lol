<p>For the longest time - well, not really the longest time but there are moments when it seems like it's been forever - I've been attempting to patch together my own Emacs config.</p>
<p>Having gone from Spacemacs, Purcell, Vanilla, Doom, Prelude, handcrafted, literate, back again through multiple attempts at each of the previous as well as pouring through everybody else's (and their dogs - hello, Corgi!) configs I have finally come to a conclusion.</p>
<p>I figure that since I basically always wind up trying to reinvent Doom Emacs, that I might as well meet them in the middle and move over to recreating Doom with a complete literate Doom config.</p>
<p>I've seen a handful of users that have done this, and while getting it bootstrapped was a little interesting, I think it's going to work really well.</p>
<p>As it's basically an art form, my Emacs config is never done - but I've got it to a point where I'm happy with it.</p>
<p>I do actually like some of the convenience macros that are provided with the Doom Emacs framework. It makes a really excellent library.</p>
<p>Will I stay with this? You know, I think that since I generally always found my way back to Doom (even though I don't use evil key bindings), plus with my desire to have &quot;my own thing&quot;....yeah, maybe.</p>
<p>Just maybe.</p>
<p>This might be my final form.</p>
<p>Minus some tweaking.</p>
<p>One of these days I'll have to get back to doing weekly link dumps.</p>
<p>This is post 65/100 of my #100DaysToOffload posts. You can read the other posts in this series <a href="/tags/100daystooffload">here</a>.</p>
