<p>I suppose this is the first milestone that I've reached for the 100 Days To Offload challenge - post number 25!</p>
<p>As those who have read many of my previous posts (and, thank you for that!) you may know that I have struggled of late with some aspects of my keto lifestyle. Not so much the keto part, per se, so much as the amount of calories that I haven't been logging and keeping account of.</p>
<p>In other words, snacking.</p>
<p>I was standing in the kitchen earlier today, having toasted a slice of &quot;keto friendly&quot; bread (the heel, if you're curious), buttered and cinnamon &quot;sugar&quot; topped....and stared at it.</p>
<p>I took a bit of a pause at that moment: <em>did I really want to eat this</em>? I've gone from thinking that I could easily do a 24 hour fast (perhaps even going longer for more frequent timing), to this undesirable feeling that I've got to snack.</p>
<p>It's not even that I feel hungry.</p>
<p>I used to eat out of boredom, maybe that's what I'm going back to? I need to get back in the game, my head is just a bit on the spacey side.</p>
<p>I need to be able to look in the mirror again and be proud of what I've accomplished.</p>
<p>It's a strange feeling.</p>
<h3 id="in-the-world-of-work">In the world of work</h3>
<p>I was able to get one new task taken care of earlier today. While nothing earth shattering, it was an important item that needs to be done and it makes me a little more useful - not a bad thing.</p>
<p>Now, I'm getting to work late/after &quot;normal&quot; hours to essentially babysit another application upgrade.</p>
<p>Not that I mind, it should be uneventful. But you never know.</p>
<p>The main fun with this type of work is that you get to do it while everybody else in the house is home and I'm downstairs in the &quot;dining room&quot;.</p>
<p>At least all I should have to do is monitor some CPU cycles then re-enable some schedules.</p>
<p>....and that went off without a hitch.</p>
<p>Until next time, we shall leave it at that.</p>
<p>This is post 25/100 of my #100DaysToOffload posts. You can read the other posts in this series <a href="/tags/100daystooffload">here</a>.</p>
