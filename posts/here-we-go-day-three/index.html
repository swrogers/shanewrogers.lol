<p>It's day three of Weblog Posting Month 2024!</p>
<p>Whew!</p>
<p>I'll be honest, I was beginning to wonder if I was going to make it today. Today has been challenging, to say the least, so I will be putting off today's reading of the &quot;Writing to Learn&quot; book.</p>
<p>&quot;Why is that?&quot; - I hear absolutely noone asking. Well, I'll tell you anyhow. I do much of my blog posting through <code>emacs</code> using <code>org-mode</code> capture templates. My current <code>emacs</code> configuration is a semi modified <a href="https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs">doom emacs</a> build which has worked very well for me in the past and continues to do so in the present. Generally. I don't know if I had some kind of hardware issue (which is possible, as my config is hosted on a local NAS with used drives) due to perhaps a recent storm, but my org capture templates were just not working at all. Even after a <code>doom doctor</code>, <code>doom purge</code>, <code>doom build</code> cycle...nothing worked.</p>
<p>Which necessitated a <em>nuclear option</em> of a fresh git checkout of doom and starting over. It's not really a complete do over, though, since I still have my private/personal doom init files that live in a different directory.</p>
<p>All in all, after about an hour and ten minutes of waiting for the build process to finish (ugh...) we are back to par. Yippee.</p>
<h3 id="the-actual-challenge">The actual challenge</h3>
<p>Everything stated, I have actually read a bit of the next chapter, and all of the above was initiated because I wanted to take a handful of notes. One item in particular, about clear writing being evidence of clear thinking. Something of which I really need to strive to do - think clearly. With that, and just a little bit of focus, perhaps I can write clearly.</p>
