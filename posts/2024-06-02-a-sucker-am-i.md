I kept telling myself that I wasn't going to go through with it, that I've already spent enough money on games - specifically my Steam backlog - but they just keep pulling me back in.

Silly sales. Gah, dang it.

It's half off now, so naturally I've got to make one **last, final** splurge. At least I've only bought one copy of this title. Ha!

Now, all I've got to do is wait for the thing to download and install. Only 11.6 Gigs down, another 75 Gigs to go. It's disgusting. ðŸ˜‘
