<p>Whew, one day post birthday and one more on the books.</p>
<p>For myself, I consider my birthday to be just another day. I can't say that I really care how the day goes, one way or the other. I would assume, like most other adults my age - it's just another day.</p>
<p>I'm 47 as of yesterday. It's not a milestone year, just another step in the path.</p>
<p>I don't feel 47. It's no different to me than, say 42 or 45.</p>
<p>It's kind of surreal, if I were to say it was anything.</p>
<p>When you're a kid, you don't really think of middle age. It's just something that you don't really see yourself being.</p>
<p>Then, all of a sudden, your trying to put things into perspective. I try to place myself into my father's mindset and shoes and whatever when he was my age. How things were back then.</p>
<p>How things have changed.</p>
<p>I'm sure there's a word for the way I think, the way I feel.</p>
<p>Ah well.</p>
<h3 id="b-day-stuff">B-Day Stuff</h3>
<p>The day before my birthday, we made pizza for the kiddos so the wife and I could get out and have a good dinner. I guess by good, I mean expensive.</p>
<p>Well, of course it was good. We went out to a local fish house and raw bar. Big plate of broccolini and a delicious Greek salad with some of the sweetest cherry tomatoes we'd ever had. Then a large plate of oysters, shrimp, lobster tail and snow crab. Pretty good.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we went to Worlds of Fun. Probably not the best idea as it was super busy. Gotta love lines. We were there maybe six hours and my eldest twin and I only rode three things. We've got passes, though, so we'll go back eventually.</p>
<p>Today, we are just relaxing. New school year shoe purchases and mowing the lawn.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, while not the first day of school, is close enough that the flurry will commence. I'm a little anxious about it all, the mornings are going to be really hectic around here.</p>

DEFCON is going on currently, and I love a good tale. I imagine that most of us have received those stupid &quot;USPS&quot; delivery package text messages. Here, Grant tells the tale of, ahem, someone taking things into their own hands.</li>

I don't really write in Go, but I'd like to. This seems like a decent list of what to avoid, perhaps.</li>

I don't think I could explain it any better than they could: <em>It's like Font Awesome, but for Platforms &amp; Protocols</em></li>

I'm more of an Emacs user, but I can certainly appreciate Wordstar. Here is an <strong>awesome</strong> package put together by author Robert J Sawyer.</li>

<p>With that, I think we're good.</p>
