<p>We've been watching a lot of streaming shows over the past couple of days.</p>
<p>I didn't normally go in for the binge mentality of how things seem to be these days, although I haven't ever been against waiting things out for a few weeks to let the (old school) DVR (or, even older Tivo) build up a few weeks worth of episodes to watch.</p>
<p>I still prefer to not watch them all at once.</p>
<p>Still though, it does happen.</p>
<p>Yesterday we watched the entirety of <a href="https://m.imdb.com/title/tt16283824/">Eric</a> on Netflix. It was a pretty decent tale, with a handful of threads that wove together okay. I think that it could probably have been cut down by an hour/an episode, but all things considered it was enjoyable.</p>
<p>Today we finished up with Netflix's <a href="https://m.imdb.com/title/tt14403178/">Beef</a>. We had watched the first episode the other day, and worked out way through the rest of them today. I really like all of the A24 stuff that I've seen, and this was not too bad either. Granted, the overall story is just insane enough...but then so was Eric.</p>
<p>So far as other television stuff, I've got my YouTube TV set to record <em>all the Olympics</em> stuff, so I'll watch some of that in time. I'm more of a Winter fan than Summer, though.</p>
<p>Of course we're also watching <a href="https://m.imdb.com/title/tt11198330/">House of the Dragon</a> and <a href="https://m.imdb.com/title/tt1190634/">The Boys</a>, as one is aught to do.</p>
<h3 id="link-dump">Link Dump</h3>
<p>I think I can come up with a small handful of links this week, so let us see what's out there.</p>
<p><a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2024/07/28/spyware-turned-this-kansas-high-school-into-a-red-zone-of-dystopian-surveillance/">Spyware turned this Kansas high school into a ‚Äòred zone‚Äô of dystopian surveillance</a> We had our own little run in with this particular piece of software last year as well, and I can't really honestly say that I'm a fan. I get it, but I don't care for it.</p>
<p><a href="https://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-writ-large.html">Literate Programming Writ Large</a>
Howard Abrams is an excellent resource on literate programming in emacs and org mode, this article continues on with more great information along that line.</p>
<p>....and that, as they say, is that.</p>
<p>Until next time my friends.</p>
