Time to play a little bit of catch-up, seeing as I didn't post anything yesterday. Or the day before.

I shall wait for the collective "aww, shucks, we sure missed reading your stuff!", because, yeah, it's still basically just for myself. Which is totally cool with me.

### Last Week
Not a whole heck of a lot going on last week really.

Picked up the new work laptop so I could replace the one that has basically had the battery and keyboard crap all over itself, so that's been fun. Which, I'm pretty sure that nobody in the history of the world has ever actually said. While I do have backups of everything and don't have much to worry about in that department, getting the new machine all sorted out is just a huge pain in the rear.

But, it is a great time to look and reflect on the applications that I *really* need to do my work with. Plus, it's been great to get away from Firefox and move my work browsing over to Vivaldi. So there is that. 

I was able to get WSL2 set up, even exported/imported my old setup image which is amazing.

We might finally have the Halloween costume situation sorted out for everyone in the house - no small feet these days. Yesterday we made a short trip to one of the regional *Spririt Halloween* stores, conveniently located near a *Costco* that we also needed to run into, to gather ideas and make a handful of purchases.

One of the twins picked up some black raven stuff, about all that we needed to get afterwards was a black overcoat and now some black pants that he won't complain about. Wish us luck there. The overcoat was not very easy to find and we wound up spending a bit more than I'd like - but, we sure do love our kids, right?

The other twin was going to go with a Knight theme, but decided last minute not to go that route. Now he's going with an anime character. We had to order his costume last night, and the hope now is that it *fits him* and *isn't made super cheaply*. So, we'll see there.

The wife picked up some cool face masks, the favorite at the moment would seem to be a broken doll. I really like the idea.

For myself, I procured a *Phantom of the Opera* style mask that I'm hoping is able to complement the rest of the outfit that I've got. I'm not doing a silly cape, though.

The little one already had his costume purchased - an *Ender Dragon* from *Minecraft*. 

The next to youngest (but quite possibly the most mature) of the group, still has yet to really put a finger on what he'll do. We had thought that he and a friend were gonna do some kind of matching costume set, but that seems to have changed. Last year they did *Mario and Luigi*, the year before was the *Sun and Moon*. I don't know what they'll do yet.

I do believe that was basically most of last week (with some smattering of yesterday, alas) which brings us to...

### This Week
It's a short school week, which is always fun.

Not.

Parent teacher conferences are at the end of this week. We've really only got one kiddo who I'm concerned about, but really, all in all I can't complain about our kids.

The youngest kiddo has Fall Picture Day coming up Tuesday. Which at least kinda makes sense, moreso than the middle school who does picture day on like the third day of school. I, for one, am looking forward to when picture day happens like the week before school starts. It's only a matter of time.

We've got some other appointments happening this week too, which shouldn't be too trying.

On the work front, I'll be taking part in a demo/question/answer session for some new tools that I'm also in the middle of learning. Fun times, that.

We are also still fighting with getting things paid, so that blows chunks all over the road. Sometimes one wonders if the *right hand* is aware that the *left hand* exists and is doing things.

### Link Dump
I might even have some links to dump on the post this week.

- [HTML for people](https://htmlforpeople.com/)
I have yet to go through much of this, well, any of it really. But you can't go wrong with a good up to date source for learning HTML. From Blake Watson.

- [A KitchenAid repair shop in Kansas found a global following by ‘fighting that throwaway culture’](https://www.kcur.org/arts-life/2024-10-11/were-fighting-that-throwaway-culture-local-kitchenaid-repair-shop-gains-international-following)
Thought this was pretty cool, given that it's from the home State.

- [The Disappearance of an Internet Domain](https://every.to/p/the-disappearance-of-an-internet-domain)
I have seen a lot of talk about this, given recent politcal happenings. This might be something to keep an eye on. I don't have any dot-io domains, but I do use some dot-io services.

- [We only learnt of our son’s secret online life after he died at 25](https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/parenting/article/we-only-learnt-of-our-sons-secret-online-life-after-he-died-at-20-rj3bqfnqn)
I'll admit, this one got me in the feels.

With that, we'll call it a day.

Until next time.
