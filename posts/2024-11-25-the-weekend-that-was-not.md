The past weekend, despite it being my three day weekend, absolutely did not feel long enough. 

It almost feels as if there were two days stolen from me.

A thought that I find unexplainable and honestly just plain weird. 

Friday and Saturday were event days, in more than a couple of ways, with Friday being the second evening of the middle school production of *Emma* and Saturday being the final showing of the same in the early afternoon.

Saturday was also something of an interesting morning as well, we went into Kansas City and checked out a couple of rescue dogs.

All right - let's get things straight first: I am **not** a dog person. I am a **cat** person. We already have a cat, who is nearing 10 years old at this point. I don't despise dogs, nor other animals, but I have come to the conclusion that I *much prefer other peoples pets*. I certainly do not have time to train and deal with a puppy.

The plan on Saturday, was not to come home with a dog. We were going to look at a couple of them, both poodle mixes: a Bernedoodle and a Sheepadoodle. 

The Berne was your run of the mill rescue animal: skittish, but not aggressive at all, just scared and wanting to go back to his enclosure. His coat was okay, soft but in definite need of grooming. We walked with him for a bit, got to see that his stool was a little on the runny and soft side - which, not completely unexpected as he's nervous, but it could also be other problems. We had about an hour to check this guy out before we had to go to the next appointment.

Next up we had the Sheepadoodle. It would be fair to say, I believe, that this lady was a complete 180 degree turnaround from the Berne. Super friendly, the people at the rescue had been with her since birth as her mama was litter bound when brought into the center. She basically choose me, it seems, a pretty lovable dog.

There are certain breeds that I really like. Old English Sheepdogs being one, though - again - I don't want one. They are gorgeous animals. They take a lot of work. But they are iconic. I don't like Poodles. Now, that could be because most poodles that I've seen have that pretentious cut and groom on them. I don't know. But, I like some of the features of Poodles: not much shedding being one of the key points. I'll say that I do like the mixes and sheepadoodles look really good to me.

So.

We probably know where this is heading.

Meet the new family member.
