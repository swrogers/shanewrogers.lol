<p>It's the afternoon and I'm sitting in the car, waiting for the two youngest to get released from school. I can't complain about how the day has gone, it's been pretty good and relatively productive. I'm just glad that the little one was able to go and stay at school all day! I love that my kids, generally, enjoy school.<p>Part of my job role involves application upgrades for some decently large vendors, Oracle and Salesforce come to mind. These upgrades can be a tad kludgy. An understatement to say the least. I've been through a handful of one upgrade in particular that I have been able to get documented fairly well, and I believe that I now have it down to, if not a science then at least an art. Art is still allowed to be messy - and this thing is no exception. I think my favorite part of this last patch cycle was that Oracle has evidently stopped providing (what appears to be) either a second copy of their jdk, or they've streamlined it into a non-versioned directory. Which I suppose is nice. At least it was easy enough to sort out.<p>We've got some other projects in the hopper at work, and it feels good to be a part of them. It almost feels like progress.<p>Ah, the kids are picked up. Some garlic olives have been snacked on (it is weird how ones tastes change when away from carbohydrates for so long). I'm sure I could ramble on more, but I think I'm good here.<p>Thanks for reading, if you are. If you're not, then that's okay too.<p>Wanna read my other <a href=/tags/weblogpomo2024>#weblogpomo2024</a> posts?
