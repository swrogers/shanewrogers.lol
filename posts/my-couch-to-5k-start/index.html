<p>Yesterday I started my first session of the <em>Couch to 5K</em> program.</p>
<p>I'm not going to say that it was completely brutal, but it was definitely a challenge for myself.</p>
<p>I've never been a runner. Nor a jogger. Heck I haven't even been much of a walker with the exception of the last year, maybe.</p>
<p>But for some reason, I've got this crazy idea that I would like to run a 5K.</p>
<p>Slowly but surely I have been trying to work my body to to being prepped, in some way, for the coming activity. By walking and trying to keep a brisk pace, by going longer and longer distances.</p>
<p>At this point, I can do right at a three mile walk in about 40 to 45 minutes. My average is just over a 13 minute mile.</p>
<p>Certainly not an Olympic caliber, but I'm okay with that.</p>
<p>Yesterday, using one of the many <em>C25k</em> apps out there, was my first stress test. I would say that I succeeded.</p>
<p>Sure, it was not easy, and yeah I was looking forward to that &quot;You are on run 8 of 8&quot; notification, but I survived.</p>
<p>I did the complete 3K (I think) trek in 30 minutes, finishing very close to the end of our trail at the conclusion of the program.</p>
<p>Of course, silly me still wanted to finalize my <em>actual</em> normal walk path, so I continued on for another less than mile.</p>
<p>That, I admit and know now, was a mistake. According to my Fitbit app, the first two miles were under 13 minutes each.</p>
<p>The last was at an over 17 minutes pace. Yeah, no good, and I felt it!</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to doing this again today!</p>
