Lucky number thirteen!

I wasn't too certain that I was going to make this one, if I were to be completely honest. It's been a day full of watching a sick kiddo and trying to keep myself in check as well. To say that it has not been a great day would be an understatement at the least.

We've had a couple of really long nights, as our youngest has been making his way into our room (which is not so different from the normal) and coughing up a storm (which is different from the norm). Hopefully he'll be able to get this thing beat soon.

I will say that I'm lucky in that my job is very flexible in allowing us to e to care for family and self. I know that not everyone is so fortunate. For that, I am thankful. 

As an aside, I have finally been able to watch **Dune Part Two**, which was excellent. I had really wanted to see it in a theater but was never able to make it. The first **Dune** was actually the he first movie I saw in the theater after the world had began to open back up. Some might say post COVID, but I think that we all know we are still current COVID. Sigh. 

These entries have been good for just getting my mind settled and thawed out for the day. While nowhere near what I had intended to write about, I hope to be able to continue on this path. Whether anyone reads them or not, matters not to me.
