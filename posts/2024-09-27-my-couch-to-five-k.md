Yesterday I started my first session of the *Couch to 5K* program. 

I'm not going to say that it was completely brutal, but it was definitely a challenge for myself. 

I've never been a runner. Nor a jogger. Heck I haven't even been much of a walker with the exception of the last year, maybe. 

But for some reason, I've got this crazy idea that I would like to run a 5K.

Slowly but surely I have been trying to work my body to to being prepped, in some way, for the coming activity. By walking and trying to keep a brisk pace, by going longer and longer distances. 

At this point, I can do right at a three mile walk in about 40 to 45 minutes. My average is just over a 13 minute mile.

Certainly not an Olympic caliber, but I'm okay with that.

Yesterday, using one of the many *C25k* apps out there, was my first stress test. I would say that I succeeded.

Sure, it was not easy, and yeah I was looking forward to that "You are on run 8 of 8" notification, but I survived.

I did the complete 3K (I think) trek in 30 minutes, finishing very close to the end of our trail at the conclusion of the program.

Of course, silly me still wanted to finalize my *actual* normal walk path, so I continued on for another less than mile. 

That, I admit and know now, was a mistake. According to my Fitbit app, the first two miles were under 13 minutes each.

The last was at an over 17 minutes pace. Yeah, no good, and I felt it!

I'm looking forward to doing this again today!
