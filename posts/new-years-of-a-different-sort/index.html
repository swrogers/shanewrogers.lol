<p>The new school season is nearly upon us once again.</p>
<p>We will have three kiddos back in the same building, at least for a little while, with but two grades between them. Not that they don't always have, or that they won't always have two grades between them. Sometimes we forget that the youngest of these three is the <em>youngest</em> of the three - this kiddo has seemed for some time now to be the more mature of them all. Always a surprise to me and also I must admit that I am not overly certain that I am deserving of such amazing children.</p>
<p>One of the twins will be spending the first part of some days at another school taking higher level math courses. Similar to what the youngest kiddo was going through last year, when he bussed from the elementary school to the middle school for his math course. I am more scared for the elder twin, though, than I was for the younger brother. Probably has to do with the fact he'll be going into a High School, opposed to a middle school.</p>
<p>I think that everybody will do fine, but as a parent I think I'm allowed to feel that fear for my kiddo.</p>
<p>We also find ourselves near the time of open enrollment for insurance.</p>
<p>This year, I'm definitely looking forward to making some changes there. My wife has recently - this is her third week - started working at the same employer as I. Which means that we'll get to save a not insignificant amount of money on insurance! She will take over her own insurance plan and payment, using the same provider. I will continue to cover the kids and myself. All in, we look to save about $500 a month for coverage.</p>
<p>It is insane.</p>
<p>I have slowly been working my way through <a href="https://thebookofelsewhere.com/">the book of elsewhere</a>, taking a bit of a break from The Expanse books. The hope is that I can finish reading this before my hardback copy of the BRZRKR graphic novel arrives, which should arrive early October I think. Plenty of time, right?</p>
