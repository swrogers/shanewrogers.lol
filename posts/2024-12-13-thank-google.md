I did a thing last night that I never thought I'd ever do.

For the first time in longer than I can remember, I now reside in a home that does not subscribe to some kind of non-ota television service. 

I've been subscribed, well *been* subscribed, to YouTube TV since almost day one. Sucked into the whole Google everything and the kick butt "DVR" that came along in tow. 

I even talked multiple people into signing up, it really was a great value.

Yeah. At $73 a month it was time to rethink the subscription. The only thing I was really using it for at the time was to put PBS on, or maybe the occasional Daily Show. 

I had been considering saving the monthly cost, but just hadn't pulled the trigger on the cut. But, at $83 a month I'm out. Not that anyone really cares, but yeah.

I swapped over my MAX add-on to Prime. Went ahead and decided that I might as well throw three more bucks Jeff's way and go AD free on Prime as well. I imagine I'll also toss some cash into the coffers of my local KPR station since I listen to them quite a lot.

So far as PBS goes, I've been a supporter of the Kansas City station for some time, so I've got their passport into the app for viewing their content.

My only complaint: We've got an LG TV, and while I love WebOS they don't have a PBS Passport application. I'll have to either dig my Chromecast back out, vor maybe look into another option.

It'll be nice to save a bit more cash this year! Thank you, Google!!
