Sometimes I just don't really know. 

There are days that I just want to give up. 

Throw in the towel. 

Half of today was one of those. 

Things were okay for the most part, but then, the crap just gets flung into my face. 

Then, I turn irrationally angry. 

My mood sours and I become dour.

I just, don't know. 

I guess I'm glad I've not done anything I won't regret doing. 

Right?
