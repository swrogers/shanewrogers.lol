I shudder to think. I've never really been a huge fan of that whole ecosystem.</p>\n<p>It's not as bad as the JavaScript world, but it's not fun to navigate for me either.</p>\n<p>I was wanting to get a <a href=\"https://diasporafoundation.org/\">Diaspora</a> instance set up on a digital ocean droplet, but decided against it. Then, to follow along in some other rabbit hole, I signed up on Yet Another ActivityPub Instance, in the form of <a href=\"https://akkomane.social/@shane\">Akkomane Social</a>. It seems nice, thus far.</p>\n<p>In other news, yeah - it's been a week.</p>\n<p>It's also only Wednesday.</p>\n",
