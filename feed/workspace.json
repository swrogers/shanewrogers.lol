      "content_html": "<p>Just because the May challenge is over doesn't mean that I can't still try to keep some writing going.</p>\n<p>As I had stated earlier, I've had the opportunity to move my workspace into a downstairs location, and I think I kind of like how things are situated now. It's a good feeling to have a nice clean start, without quite so much clutter. I had even brought another box down, but said to myself: &quot;Self, do I really need to bring all this crap down here? No. No I do not.&quot; At which point, I promptly packed that box back and trotted it right back upstairs.</p>\n<p>Probably one of the nicest bonuses to having this setup down here is that I can dock my SteamDeck and play it without feeling too guilty about not being around the family. I don't get a whole lot of time to game these days, so I haven't really been able to take advantage of having my Deck. Now, maybe that can change.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.some.pics/swrogers/665b8cc3b09c1.jpg\" alt=\"Cropped image of my work area, with the Steamdeck docked.\"></p>\n<p>All right, with that I think it's getting to be about time to get some dinner prepped. It's spaghetti squash with homemade alfredo night, with a side of asparagus.</p>\n<p>Have a good night all!</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>All of the following is more for myself and future reference than anything. (Though, who am I kidding, this whole blog thing is all personal future reference, isn't it?)</p>\n<p>I figure that I've been blogging this way for a month or better at this point, so it might be worthwhile to get down what my current process is for getting a post up. I'll even include some nifty screenshots. All from mobile, even!</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-process\">The process <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#the-process\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Currently my site is statically generated by way of eleventy, hosted on GitHub pages, using porkbun as DNS.</p>\n<p>My writing is done using Zettel Notes on Android, using Markdown and it connects to my GitHub repository to push and pull as needed. The push triggers a GitHub action to update the static pages.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-flow\">The flow <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#the-flow\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Here is where I start things off, using Zettel Notes I open my &quot;local&quot; storage on my phone via the App Directory.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.some.pics/swrogers/666086db7dca8.png\" alt=\"Zettel Notes screenshot on Android. Shows a portion of the side menu.\"></p>\n<p>I've got a handful of templates and half started junk in here - I really should clean this out. The main item of interest is the <code>blog-template-default.md</code> file here, though.</p>\n<p>I open that file up and copy the contents...<br>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.some.pics/swrogers/6660872d78e5f.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the Zettel Notes app on Android. Shows the main &quot;App Folder&quot; directory listing where I keep my blog drafts and templates.\"></p>\n<p>...into a new entry within the Blog drafts directory. Ive got Zettel set up to automatically name the new note entries with the date as I like, I just have to add the rest of the file name and the extension.</p>\n<p>To the rest of the yaml front matter I will add the title, change the date (the only thing I have yet to figure out if is easily automated in Zettel or not) and the tags.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.some.pics/swrogers/6660878ee41f6.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the Zettel Notes application on Android. Shows the text of the yaml front matter that I use for my default blog posts.\"></p>\n<p>After I edit the file, I then manually copy the note into the posts directory of the Lol Blog section/repository and refresh the listing. This initiates the needed push to start the publishing process.</p>\n<p>Any images that I use, I have just been uploading to my omg.lol pictures area and copying the markdown links. It works.</p>\n<p>It's all kind of clunky, manual, somewhat kludgy, but it works for me.</p>\n",

It's like the gift that keeps on giving.</p>\n<p>Not in a good way.</p>\n<p>But then, how often are things &quot;good&quot; when <strong>that</strong> particular phrase comes into play. Yeah, not all that often.</p>\n<p>So after paying too stonking much for repairs due to a, um, we shall say &quot;self imposed&quot; accident, now it looks like we might have a little bit of salt rubbed into that festering wound.</p>\n<p>You know, for good measure.</p>\n<p>While it's probably entirely coincidental, it looks like we'll be replacing the battery in the beast. Twice today when going to start it up we've experienced a series of error checks (ECS, BCW, blah blah blah) and clicks and basically what looks like a computer system spasming out and proverbially vomiting all over itself.</p>\n<p>It's great. The vehicle is a 2021, so I guess it's about that time for the OEM battery to go. At least that's the opinion of the interwebs, that they'll last about 2.5 years. I don't mind, really. Having the battery die or running out of gas are about two of the larger vehicle fears that I have.</p>\n<p>Hopefully that's what the problem is.</p>\n",
