    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today is Thursday, February 20, in this, what has been yet another exceptionally long week in this year of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kiddos had school,  thus far, only one day this week due to insanely cold weather and snowy conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve had whatever illness run through our home over the last couple of weeks,  with the youngest finally getting over most of what he had yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weekend is going to be good and busy as well. We&#39;ve got the youngest kiddo&#39;s bday party lined up at a really cool playplace in town, paired up with a friend whose kiddo shares a pretty close date as well - so we just rented the whole place for the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve got to look at getting a cake made too, for either his actual birthday or the same evening. He likes Minecraft,  so at least that should be easier than, oh, a Dalek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve got a handful - six - of old phones that need to be reset and packed up to send in for rebates. That&#39;ll be fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s all I&#39;ve got at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is post 74/100 of my #100DaysToOffload posts. You can read the other posts in this series &lt;a href=&quot;https://shanewrogers.lol/tags/100daystooffload&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Yep, It&#39;s Gonna Be A Loss</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As you most likely do not recall, back in middle December I decided to give my thumb a &lt;a href=&quot;https://shanewrogers.lol/posts/a-day-of-firsts&quot;&gt;smashing good time in my car door&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It hurt quite a lot and after doing the drainage thing for a handful of days it started feeling much better and the healing process began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that the healing process hadn&#39;t &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; began the instant it happened, but, yeah. Very nearly the entire undernail and nail bed bruised and it (still) kinda looked like I had painted that particular fingernail black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hope was that I was not going to lose the nail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For awhile it sure seemed like I was in the clear on that one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you probably might guess, it does appear that I&#39;ll be losing the nail. Not that it&#39;s anything major, just kinda some suckage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made the mistake of picking at the edge of the nail, which then more or less started the displacement of it all. The other day I was putting my jacket on, getting it zipped and cozy, and somehow - someway - caught the edge of my thumbnail in the cloth. Half the nailbed came out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had to do some trim work on it, will probably be doing trimwork on it for the next few weeks or so. Sleeping with a bandaid on it so I don&#39;t catch it on anything in my sleep and rip the bad boy out. That would suck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is certainly gnarly, and has been quite some time since this has happened to any of my nails. Our oldest has had the privilege of losing not &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; nails in his short life thus far.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New phone setup day</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Received the new phone yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve moved on from one provider,  T-MOBILE, to another,  ATT. Not really sure which is better at this point - they are basically all just a commodity now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My line was the last to arrive and the last to be ported, out of six I believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything with the setup went okay, just trying to get the final number actually ported and the esim activated took about an hour on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, my wife probably spent about five hours on the phone with the ATT Costco support line. Way more than desired, and a lot more than we&#39;ve spent with support on T-MOBILE over the course of 18 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But. Now we should be good. Now we worry about having everything we need from the old phones before we wipe them and send them on their merry way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall though, I do kinda like the new device. I&#39;ve been a Google Pixel user and disciple since the OG XL, so it&#39;s a little different to be away and on the Samsung 25 Ultra train.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do like the stylus though, haven&#39;t had one of those since the Note 7. Which I did not have very long.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Still doing some final checks and balances on things around these parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed that, for some reason, that old &amp;quot;holiday&amp;quot; post decided to show up in the feed and echofeed grabbed it as well. Not sure what that was about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do know that I had to redo the git repo, again, seeing as how Zettel Notes still had an older version and, with the merge settings I have, happily forced up the older branch. Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All right. Let&#39;s see how this one pops up!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A New Look</title>

    <id>https://shanewrogers.lol/posts/a-new-look/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For those that might be paying attention you&#39;ll notice that I&#39;ve changed up the templating for the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those that follow this site in their RSS feeds (probably just me, honestly), I&#39;ll apologize for the spammage that was just sent your way. Fortunately it looks like it was only limited to the last 10 posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve moved from the old &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent&quot;&gt;eleventy-excellent&lt;/a&gt; fork that I had, to a design based around the standard &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog&quot;&gt;eleventy base&lt;/a&gt; blog design - with a spritzing of &lt;a href=&quot;https://readable-css.freedomtowrite.org&quot;&gt;readable css&lt;/a&gt;. Trying to keep things simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The home page is basically the &amp;quot;about me&amp;quot; page that seems to be the popular thing to do these days, along with the latest 5 posts and 5 links that I&#39;ll eventually populate. I don&#39;t know that I&#39;ll do a whole linkroll/linkblog/whatever, and I&#39;ll certainly not replace raindrop.io with this, but it&#39;s just yet another section for content and a place to save yet more things for me to lose track of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d say this was a lot more difficult than it needed to be, but I think I was just overcomplicating the whole &amp;quot;multiple remotes&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;multiple branches&amp;quot; git thing. Still hosted on github pages, still in the same repo. Yippee.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The anxious one</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t believe that I have, at least not in some time, had a weekend fly by as quickly as this past weekend did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, I do have to admit that it was great that it went by as quickly and smoothly as it did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may, or may not know - or care about really - we have had a sheepadoodle in the home since late November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is still basically attached to me at the hip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would say she&#39;s a quiet dog, but, there are points where her protective side comes out. Hmmm, well, I don&#39;t know that I would say protective so much as scared and anxious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wish that we knew what she was scared about. Whatever it is, she most definitely &lt;em&gt;does not&lt;/em&gt; like non household members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barks. Some growling. Not mean, just letting everyone know that she&#39;s not happy. Then there are the accidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least our floor is polished concrete so it&#39;s easy to clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that&#39;s a lot of background to say that we also had an additional dog in the house this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second dog was much easier going, but naturally our girl was not happy. Not at first, nor second. She did eventually come around. Sort of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had thought it was going to be a long weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it really wasn&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who would have thought.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, yesterday (or the day before) my wife had a Costco run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, not a big deal. Despite the fact that it does run us a few hundred bucks a shot. But that does come with a family of seven. Lots of (teen) mouths to feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, part of what she picked up while there, something that was completely unexpected, is that we are now in the process of swapping cellular providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve had T-Mobile for just shy of 20 years. I hate, hate, hate to say that we&#39;ll now be on ATT. But, by making the swap out bill will be lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe we&#39;ll swap providers every time we finalize the conditions of the contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be nice to have a phone with a stylus again.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mobile templates FTW</title>
    <link href="https://shanewrogers.lol/posts/mobile-templates-ftw/" />
    <updated>2025-01-31T23:39:17Z</updated>
    <id>https://shanewrogers.lol/posts/mobile-templates-ftw/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t generally like to *meta post&amp;quot;, blog about blogging and all that...but there are times that I shall make an exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have finally decided that it is high time to take advantage of some of the features my mobile note taking application has - namely that it does offer templates and widget creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of which is to create a new note using a template, naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In becoming more comfortable with the use of capture templates on my desktop using org-mode and Emacs, I figure that I might as well try to take at least &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of the friction out of blogging on the mobile side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially seeing as that&#39;s where I do the vast majority of my posting from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Zettel Notes &lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt; write in org format, I&#39;m using eleventy for my site and markdown for my content. So no org capture setup on the mobile side, sadly. However, Zettel does have a simple template editor that can fill in quite nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, now I no longer have to remember to change the dateline in my content. That&#39;s a win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just have to keep better track of which post number I&#39;m on for my current writing challenge. Meh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if I could just figure out how to get Zettel to prompt me for a post title, we might be on business. Although, sometimes I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m gonna name things until I&#39;m done.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ugh, I just haven&#39;t been feeling it lately!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had even made the attempt to start a post the other day. Got as far as copying my template over to the ol&#39; draft folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dunno what happened but that&#39;s as far as that went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been kinda &lt;em&gt;meh&lt;/em&gt; around these parts lately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least &lt;strong&gt;most&lt;/strong&gt; of the snow has gone, the temperature has kinda been decent (for what that&#39;s worth at this point), and everything has been more or less healthy around the household.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been some points of interest though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to pick up a new smoke/carbon monoxide detector for our hallway. Just have not been able to get to the store yet for a replacement. I did, however, at least get an adapter kit so I can just reuse the existing wire harness with the new style that Kidde goes with these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We attended parents night at the local High School the other day. The twins start 9th grade next year, and it&#39;s always good to feel prepared. I feel that we (well, &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;, at least) are more prepped for these two than we were for their older brother. I still think, sometimes, that poor kiddo got the worst end of the stick from me. I love the hell out of him, but I just didn&#39;t know what I was doing through the whole thing. However, despite that lack from me, has turned out pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m just glad that our Cameron&#39;s Coffee order came through before those prices shot through the roof. Plus, I already had a four pack case (we have a monthly standing order for four 32oz bags) just sitting around. We go through a case a month in our house. I&#39;m not looking forward to the future there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now.&lt;/p&gt;
