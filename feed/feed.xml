    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t believe that I have, at least not in some time, had a weekend fly by as quickly as this past weekend did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, I do have to admit that it was great that it went by as quickly and smoothly as it did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may, or may not know - or care about really - we have had a sheepadoodle in the home since late November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is still basically attached to me at the hip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would say she&#39;s a quiet dog, but, there are points where her protective side comes out. Hmmm, well, I don&#39;t know that I would say protective so much as scared and anxious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wish that we knew what she was scared about. Whatever it is, she most definitely &lt;em&gt;does not&lt;/em&gt; like non household members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barks. Some growling. Not mean, just letting everyone know that she&#39;s not happy. Then there are the accidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least our floor is polished concrete so it&#39;s easy to clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that&#39;s a lot of background to say that we also had an additional dog in the house this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second dog was much easier going, but naturally our girl was not happy. Not at first, nor second. She did eventually come around. Sort of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had thought it was going to be a long weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it really wasn&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who would have thought.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, yesterday (or the day before) my wife had a Costco run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, not a big deal. Despite the fact that it does run us a few hundred bucks a shot. But that does come with a family of seven. Lots of (teen) mouths to feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, part of what she picked up while there, something that was completely unexpected, is that we are now in the process of swapping cellular providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve had T-Mobile for just shy of 20 years. I hate, hate, hate to say that we&#39;ll now be on ATT. But, by making the swap out bill will be lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe we&#39;ll swap providers every time we finalize the conditions of the contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be nice to have a phone with a stylus again.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mobile templates FTW</title>
    <link href="https://example.com/posts/mobile-templates-ftw/" />
    <updated>2025-01-31T23:39:17Z</updated>
    <id>https://example.com/posts/mobile-templates-ftw/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t generally like to *meta post&amp;quot;, blog about blogging and all that...but there are times that I shall make an exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have finally decided that it is high time to take advantage of some of the features my mobile note taking application has - namely that it does offer templates and widget creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of which is to create a new note using a template, naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In becoming more comfortable with the use of capture templates on my desktop using org-mode and Emacs, I figure that I might as well try to take at least &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of the friction out of blogging on the mobile side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially seeing as that&#39;s where I do the vast majority of my posting from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Zettel Notes &lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt; write in org format, I&#39;m using eleventy for my site and markdown for my content. So no org capture setup on the mobile side, sadly. However, Zettel does have a simple template editor that can fill in quite nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, now I no longer have to remember to change the dateline in my content. That&#39;s a win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just have to keep better track of which post number I&#39;m on for my current writing challenge. Meh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if I could just figure out how to get Zettel to prompt me for a post title, we might be on business. Although, sometimes I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m gonna name things until I&#39;m done.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ugh, I just haven&#39;t been feeling it lately!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had even made the attempt to start a post the other day. Got as far as copying my template over to the ol&#39; draft folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dunno what happened but that&#39;s as far as that went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been kinda &lt;em&gt;meh&lt;/em&gt; around these parts lately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least &lt;strong&gt;most&lt;/strong&gt; of the snow has gone, the temperature has kinda been decent (for what that&#39;s worth at this point), and everything has been more or less healthy around the household.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been some points of interest though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to pick up a new smoke/carbon monoxide detector for our hallway. Just have not been able to get to the store yet for a replacement. I did, however, at least get an adapter kit so I can just reuse the existing wire harness with the new style that Kidde goes with these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We attended parents night at the local High School the other day. The twins start 9th grade next year, and it&#39;s always good to feel prepared. I feel that we (well, &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;, at least) are more prepped for these two than we were for their older brother. I still think, sometimes, that poor kiddo got the worst end of the stick from me. I love the hell out of him, but I just didn&#39;t know what I was doing through the whole thing. However, despite that lack from me, has turned out pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m just glad that our Cameron&#39;s Coffee order came through before those prices shot through the roof. Plus, I already had a four pack case (we have a monthly standing order for four 32oz bags) just sitting around. We go through a case a month in our house. I&#39;m not looking forward to the future there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sitting here, with my youngest twin kiddo, doing some checks to re-ensure that everything is going to be okay with him physically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years ago, he was diagnosed with a hole in his heart, though it was believed to have closed up enough to allow him to do things he enjoys doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like, running. Cross country, track. Things like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, we see and experience what happens with friends, family and acquaintances. Loved ones are lost due to undiagnosed problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we double check. EKG. Echo&#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want our kids to be healthy. Happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do the things they want to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when your kiddo complains about his chest hurting, his body hurting, and doesn&#39;t want to connect the dots from post athletic event to the actual pain. Then we need to step in and push pause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t want to take these things away. I enjoy taking him to them and watching him do them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s friendship and comraderie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We just need to know.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>My final Doom form</title>

    <updated>2025-01-19T03:05:11Z</updated>
    <id>https://example.com/posts/my-final-doom-form/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the longest time - well, not really the longest time but there are moments when it seems like it&#39;s been forever - I&#39;ve been attempting to patch together my own Emacs config.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having gone from Spacemacs, Purcell, Vanilla, Doom, Prelude, handcrafted, literate, back again through multiple attempts at each of the previous as well as pouring through everybody else&#39;s (and their dogs - hello, Corgi!) configs I have finally come to a conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figure that since I basically always wind up trying to reinvent Doom Emacs, that I might as well meet them in the middle and move over to recreating Doom with a complete literate Doom config.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve seen a handful of users that have done this, and while getting it bootstrapped was a little interesting, I think it&#39;s going to work really well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it&#39;s basically an art form, my Emacs config is never done - but I&#39;ve got it to a point where I&#39;m happy with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do actually like some of the convenience macros that are provided with the Doom Emacs framework. It makes a really excellent library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will I stay with this? You know, I think that since I generally always found my way back to Doom (even though I don&#39;t use evil key bindings), plus with my desire to have &amp;quot;my own thing&amp;quot;....yeah, maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might be my final form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minus some tweaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these days I&#39;ll have to get back to doing weekly link dumps.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uncertain refrigerator</title>
    <link href="https://example.com/posts/uncertain-refrigerator/" />
    <updated>2025-01-09T21:05:11Z</updated>
    <id>https://example.com/posts/uncertain-refrigerator/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If it isn&#39;t one thing it&#39;s about seventy three others with our luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we moved into our home over nine years ago we had to pick up a few appliances. A refrigerator, washer and dryer, we also procured a stand up freezer for the garage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The house came with dishwasher, range and microwave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After tomorrow, only two (!) of those items will remain as original.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The warranty on our fridge, an LG, ran out after 5 years had passed. We just &lt;em&gt;barely&lt;/em&gt; squeaked in a warranty covered repair to the compressor on it, mere months before the expiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The washer and dryer unit that we originally bought, well, that I originally picked out because of cost (either Maytag or Whirlpool, I don&#39;t recall at this point) have been replaced. Twice. (The original units, believe it or not, &lt;em&gt;did not have a clean out for the washer&lt;/em&gt;....so eventually when all the kids socks get sucked in, you can&#39;t easily access them to clear them out.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Novembers ago, maybe three, the range died. It&#39;s been replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now... After sitting with an error code that has not allowed the external panel to work for a couple years, nor the external water and ice maker (yeah, horrible, sigh...it&#39;s tough to find them without ice) to work, the fridge has finally decided that it&#39;s the end of days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gets replaced tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This stuff is nearly impossible to work on. It&#39;s just not the same kind of items that even our parents bought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gone are the times when you grew up with the same, oh say....refrigerator...in the home throughout your childhood and young adult years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, the assigned delivery window for tomorrow&#39;s unit is right smack dab around school pick up time for the kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because, why wouldn&#39;t it be.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well we are evidently in an actua &lt;em&gt;Blizzard Warning&lt;/em&gt; now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://example.com/posts/not-the-good-kind-of-blizzard/content/img/Attachment-2025-01-05.png&quot; alt=&quot;Attachment-2025-01-05&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yippee!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attempted earlier this evening, just after dinner, to go out and grab some stuff from the store. Milk and whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had, earlier this afternoon, salted the walk and driveway. I guess I should have salted just a bit more in some areas, since I took a decent header going to the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Made it about half a block down, slip sliding all the while, until I decided that nobody needed milk that badly. Backed up and headed back home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gone maybe 5 minutes, including scraping ice off the windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I&#39;ve got a ginormous welt on the side of my left leg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s sore, but livable. Certainly huge though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woot.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Another year already</title>
    <link href="https://example.com/posts/another-year-already/" />
    <updated>2024-12-31T13:05:11Z</updated>
    <id>https://example.com/posts/another-year-already/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Has it really been a year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another one??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one gets older, it just relentlessly accelerates towards whatever the endgame is in all of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next thing we know, we shall have four more birthdays in the house - one in February, three in March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it&#39;s time for end of school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next it&#39;s school starting back up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Holiday season starts all over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere in there, we&#39;ll have to mow the lawn perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll be one year closer to half a century old. Definitely something that I never, ever would have considered anything of import during my youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, I&#39;ve never really been one for resolutions. New Year&#39;s or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They seem silly. It is the extraordinarily rare person that is able to - essentially - flip and inner switch and say &amp;quot;I&#39;m gonna do X&amp;quot; from this day onward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, goals are great. Targets and milestones are great. But they&#39;re difficult to come up with something that&#39;s achievable. I certainly don&#39;t want to feel like I&#39;ve failed at something within the first week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe that&#39;s why it took me so long to get my rear in gear on a healthier lifestyle. Keto was a thing that I feared for a decade or more. Not just the cost (which is debatable at this point) but the fear of failure looking wide over me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, are there things that I would like to accomplish within the next year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to finish reading &lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt; series. I&#39;m on &lt;em&gt;Babylon&#39;s Ashes&lt;/em&gt; currently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to get some debt paid down. That&#39;s actually plausible this year, with the wife having her own insurance this year (same everything, so no real change apart from new cards on her side). That&#39;s over $500 a month in our pocket right there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to start a vegetable garden out back, using the straw bale method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d love to get some permanent LED holiday lights set up on the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting the garage organized. Getting our bedroom organized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these things are certainly more doable than the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a closing note, I started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://hardcover.app/@swrogers&quot;&gt;Hardcover account&lt;/a&gt;. I kinda like it, but I do think I prefer the way books can be added over on OpenReads with taking pics of the barcodes. I may use both for a bit before deciding to stop using either of them, because, honesty. While I need to keep track of what books I&#39;ve got and read, I don&#39;t know that I can actually do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I should add that to my New Year&#39;s Resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
