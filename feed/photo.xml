		  &lt;p&gt;All of the following is more for myself and future reference than anything. (Though, who am I kidding, this whole blog thing is all personal future reference, isn&#39;t it?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figure that I&#39;ve been blogging this way for a month or better at this point, so it might be worthwhile to get down what my current process is for getting a post up. I&#39;ll even include some nifty screenshots. All from mobile, even!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-process&quot;&gt;The process &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#the-process&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently my site is statically generated by way of eleventy, hosted on GitHub pages, using porkbun as DNS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My writing is done using Zettel Notes on Android, using Markdown and it connects to my GitHub repository to push and pull as needed. The push triggers a GitHub action to update the static pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-flow&quot;&gt;The flow &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#the-flow&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is where I start things off, using Zettel Notes I open my &amp;quot;local&amp;quot; storage on my phone via the App Directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.some.pics/swrogers/666086db7dca8.png&quot; alt=&quot;Zettel Notes screenshot on Android. Shows a portion of the side menu.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve got a handful of templates and half started junk in here - I really should clean this out. The main item of interest is the &lt;code&gt;blog-template-default.md&lt;/code&gt; file here, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I open that file up and copy the contents...&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.some.pics/swrogers/6660872d78e5f.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the Zettel Notes app on Android. Shows the main &amp;quot;App Folder&amp;quot; directory listing where I keep my blog drafts and templates.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...into a new entry within the Blog drafts directory. Ive got Zettel set up to automatically name the new note entries with the date as I like, I just have to add the rest of the file name and the extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the rest of the yaml front matter I will add the title, change the date (the only thing I have yet to figure out if is easily automated in Zettel or not) and the tags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.some.pics/swrogers/6660878ee41f6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the Zettel Notes application on Android. Shows the text of the yaml front matter that I use for my default blog posts.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I edit the file, I then manually copy the note into the posts directory of the Lol Blog section/repository and refresh the listing. This initiates the needed push to start the publishing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any images that I use, I have just been uploading to my omg.lol pictures area and copying the markdown links. It works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s all kind of clunky, manual, somewhat kludgy, but it works for me.&lt;/p&gt;

		  &lt;p&gt;I kept telling myself that I wasn&#39;t going to go through with it, that I&#39;ve already spent enough money on games - specifically my Steam backlog - but they just keep pulling me back in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silly sales. Gah, dang it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s half off now, so naturally I&#39;ve got to make one &lt;strong&gt;last, final&lt;/strong&gt; splurge. At least I&#39;ve only bought one copy of this title. Ha!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.some.pics/swrogers/665cdd1298727.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Diablo IV being installed onto my Steam Deck in desktop mode.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, all I&#39;ve got to do is wait for the thing to download and install. Only 11.6 Gigs down, another 75 Gigs to go. It&#39;s disgusting. ðŸ˜‘&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>The Steam Deck Age</title>

		  &lt;p&gt;Just because the May challenge is over doesn&#39;t mean that I can&#39;t still try to keep some writing going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I had stated earlier, I&#39;ve had the opportunity to move my workspace into a downstairs location, and I think I kind of like how things are situated now. It&#39;s a good feeling to have a nice clean start, without quite so much clutter. I had even brought another box down, but said to myself: &amp;quot;Self, do I really need to bring all this crap down here? No. No I do not.&amp;quot; At which point, I promptly packed that box back and trotted it right back upstairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably one of the nicest bonuses to having this setup down here is that I can dock my SteamDeck and play it without feeling too guilty about not being around the family. I don&#39;t get a whole lot of time to game these days, so I haven&#39;t really been able to take advantage of having my Deck. Now, maybe that can change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.some.pics/swrogers/665b8cc3b09c1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cropped image of my work area, with the Steamdeck docked.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All right, with that I think it&#39;s getting to be about time to get some dinner prepped. It&#39;s spaghetti squash with homemade alfredo night, with a side of asparagus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a good night all!&lt;/p&gt;
