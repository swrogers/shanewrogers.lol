		  &lt;p&gt;I kept telling myself that I wasn&#39;t going to go through with it, that I&#39;ve already spent enough money on games - specifically my Steam backlog - but they just keep pulling me back in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silly sales. Gah, dang it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s half off now, so naturally I&#39;ve got to make one &lt;strong&gt;last, final&lt;/strong&gt; splurge. At least I&#39;ve only bought one copy of this title. Ha!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.some.pics/swrogers/665cdd1298727.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Diablo IV being installed onto my Steam Deck in desktop mode.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, all I&#39;ve got to do is wait for the thing to download and install. Only 11.6 Gigs down, another 75 Gigs to go. It&#39;s disgusting. ðŸ˜‘&lt;/p&gt;

		  &lt;p&gt;Just because the May challenge is over doesn&#39;t mean that I can&#39;t still try to keep some writing going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I had stated earlier, I&#39;ve had the opportunity to move my workspace into a downstairs location, and I think I kind of like how things are situated now. It&#39;s a good feeling to have a nice clean start, without quite so much clutter. I had even brought another box down, but said to myself: &amp;quot;Self, do I really need to bring all this crap down here? No. No I do not.&amp;quot; At which point, I promptly packed that box back and trotted it right back upstairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably one of the nicest bonuses to having this setup down here is that I can dock my SteamDeck and play it without feeling too guilty about not being around the family. I don&#39;t get a whole lot of time to game these days, so I haven&#39;t really been able to take advantage of having my Deck. Now, maybe that can change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.some.pics/swrogers/665b8cc3b09c1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cropped image of my work area, with the Steamdeck docked.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All right, with that I think it&#39;s getting to be about time to get some dinner prepped. It&#39;s spaghetti squash with homemade alfredo night, with a side of asparagus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a good night all!&lt;/p&gt;
