Basically they're my <em>Read It Later</em> links that I use some other web service to save for me - both the actual link, the data on the page, content and all that jazzy stuff. It's a service that I actually - shock! awe! - pay for.</p>\n<p>I'd like to have all of that data <em>here</em> on this site - well, I guess it'd be in the github repo, but still. As it is, I grab the latest 25 entries and display them on the <a href=\"/drops\">drops</a> page. I suppose at some point in time I'll actually build in some kind of link roll or link blog or whatever, that way I can have the actual history in my site - but for now this is fine.</p>\n<p>It took me way, <strong>way</strong> too stinking long to get the secrets info dealt with for the github action. Too many tangents and too many wrong turns. But things seem to be working now.</p>\n<p>Time for some breakage I think.</p>\n",
