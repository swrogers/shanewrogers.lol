Not that my site is anything special, but it'll be good for the hypothetical <em>future me</em> to be able to go back and see where things have come from.</p>\n<p>Granted, it's possible that a lot of these are also noted under my Eleventy <a href=\"http://Raindrop.io\">Raindrop.io</a> collection, but, you know - content and stuff.</p>\n<p>This page will probably be something of a living page for a bit.</p>\n<style>\nul { list-style-position: outside; }\n</style>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/yinkakun/eleventy-duo\">The Site Theme.</a></p>\n<p>It's clean and I like it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://ttntm.me/blog/creating-a-reading-list-with-eleventy-and-omnivore/\">Creating a Reading List</a></p>\n<p>Was very useful in some of the ideas of my drops page and similar. I also really like some of the other ideas that present themselves throughout the site in general - such as the main homepage landing area.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.simoncox.com/shorts/2024-03-17-11ty-collection-tag-links/\">11ty collections tag links</a></p>\n<p>Some implementation info on collections.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://nicolas-hoizey.com/articles/2023/02/08/a-bookmarklet-to-create-a-new-link-content-markdown-on-github/\">A bookmarklet to create a new link content Markdown on GitHub</a></p>\n<p>Used for the bookmarklet to add a new link entry.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://another.rodeo/linkroll/\">11ty Linkrolls</a></p>\n<p>Used in conjunction with the above to roll my own link roll page.
