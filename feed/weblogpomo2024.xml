		<content type="html">
		  &lt;p&gt;Whoa, it has &lt;strong&gt;been a week&lt;/strong&gt; this day. I&#39;m glad that it&#39;s almost over. Not only is this day, erm week, almost over, but so is the month. Which also brings us to the end of the Weblog Publishing Month challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I do believe that I accomplished the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what made today a challenge? Largely that we will most like have to have the wheel replaced on our vehicle. Naturally, the vehicle has the premium package so yeah, won&#39;t be cheap. Somebody hit a road divider turning into a parking lot and bent the inside of the wheel, popping the bead on the tire. So, not looking forward to that damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another item, which was actually positive, is that the Uber sectional super rearrangeable couch that we purchased showed up (mostly) today. Like, a week early. So we weren&#39;t prepared. But, it worked out because more people were home to help get things sorted out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I have to say that it&#39;s been a great month. I had hoped to do something different, but I think writing about my life worked out. I think that I should be able to continue this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for those that are reading.&lt;/p&gt;

		  &lt;p&gt;The first half of my day has gone pretty well so far, considering the work area move so I can keep an eye on the grand. Well, it does make it easier to keep an eye on her, but that was of course not the full reason for the move.  We still hope to have the extra room usable for the eldest soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do admit that it&#39;s nice to have a cleaner desk to work with. I still need to bring my side table and printer down, as well as get my Openmedia Vault box set back up. I miss my qemu box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus far today, I&#39;ve managed to stay firm in my determination to keep junk food out of my face. So that&#39;s a solid win. Not feeling any hunger, which is to be expected with my experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month is nearing its end, but I think I&#39;m going to continue to attempt to get something down every day. It&#39;s been easier than I expected, and I keep basically doing this for myself and none other.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>No more bag habits</title>
		<link href="https://shanewrogers.lol/posts/no-more-bag-habits/"/>
		<updated>2024-05-29T20:05:11+00:00</updated>
		<id>https://shanewrogers.lol/posts/no-more-bag-habits/</id>
		<content type="html">
		  &lt;p&gt;Bad habits. I seem to have fallen back into some of them. Most of which seem to revolve around food, which I can only blame myself really. I&#39;ve been doing a keto lifestyle since August of 2019, about five years at the time of this, and it could be said that I&#39;m still keto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I generally stay under twenty net carbs a day. No sugar. None of what works normally be considered a part of the regular American diet. It was a change that needed to be made if I wanted to live to see my kids grow up and not find myself in an early grave. By all measures the change has been a glowing success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately though, and by &lt;em&gt;lately&lt;/em&gt; I should probably qualify that with about the last year or so, I&#39;ve been really, really bad about continuing to log what does go into my body. I have been really bad about junk food. I&#39;ve probably already talked about what I consider junk food, it&#39;s not really what my fellow neighbors would consider junk. But, high calorie crap that I absolutely, positively, do not need. If I do partake, I&#39;ve got to ensure it&#39;s accounted for. I don&#39;t always do that, so shame on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning, I weighed nearly 194 pounds. Still down from 330 plus, but in my eyes, I see that getting far too close to the double century mark for my liking. This guy has got to get back into only eating when he&#39;s hungry. That&#39;s my bad habit now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never really &amp;quot;ate my feelings&amp;quot;. I always ate out of boredom or habit. It didn&#39;t take long to drop breakfast. Then lunch eventually fell as well. I need, I have the desire, to feel that hunger once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they say: &lt;strong&gt;Keep On Keto On&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		  &lt;p&gt;Good grief have I been cutting it close these past couple of days! I wound up taking the day off with a migraine and sore throat. Plus the salt in the wound that is the pink eye, which is being treated successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also got the opportunity to watch the grand today, for whatever that was worth as she wasn&#39;t feeling the best either, what with it being a new environment and not having her dad at home. It&#39;s going to take a bit for her to get used to us, but kids are very adaptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still wasn&#39;t able to make any progress on their future room, though. Not sure how well tomorrow will go in that regard either. It does make me feel kinda horrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah well, on to the latest episode of &lt;em&gt;Dark Matter&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		  &lt;p&gt;The long weekend is nearly at an end. I didn&#39;t get nearly as much done as I wanted. Color me all kinds of surprised. Did manage to get the lawn mowed and the AC fan unit hosed off, so there is that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I had really wanted to do, get the office/extra room cleared out for the eldest and the grand, didn&#39;t happen quite as planned. We need to get room cleared out in some other places first. Namely the master bedroom. My workspace is once again going to be the corner of the bedroom. I don&#39;t actually mind, I think it&#39;s more than worth it to have our eldest and his kiddo in a better situation. It&#39;s going to make things interesting around here for awhile, no doubt about it.&lt;/p&gt;

		  &lt;p&gt;Well, it&#39;s after 1500 so I guess that is should probably work on getting &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; written up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s also a long weekend here, normally that would be a good thing, but once again I just struggle to enjoy all the free time. What doesn&#39;t help this go round is that I get to play the bad guy in the house. Some people in the home want an animal, specifically a dog. I don&#39;t have anything against dogs, so long as they aren&#39;t mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that I&#39;m not a pet person. I much prefer other people&#39;s pets. I know that if we get a dog, the person that winds up taking care of it 80 percent of the time or more, will be the person writing this entry. I don&#39;t want a dog. This makes me feel like an asshole. It is what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a hard enough time keeping care of the cat and two bearded dragons that are in the home. Our walls are scratched and destroyed - at some point in time I&#39;d like to get those taken care of. The yard looks like ass right now, I don&#39;t want it to get worse nor do I relish the thought of scooping poop. We tried having a dog already. He ate part of the couch, some books, a couple of apple trees, a peach tree, a cherry tree and a fig tree. Yeah. I don&#39;t want a dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d almost consider going back into the office to work before that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that turned into a thing.&lt;/p&gt;

		  &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been a day of feeling absolutely miserable. Took a couple of benadryl may night, with the hope being that I might be able to some decent sleep to go along with being stopped up with a sore throat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that didn&#39;t work too well. While I was basically falling asleep at 22:00 last night, I also managed to forget to put the recycling and trash out for the morning. At least I was able to get them out this morning. The problem with benadryl is that it takes forever to wear out of my system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So even right now, at 1700 the next day, I feel like I could go to bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least the grand daughter wasn&#39;t too bad today! She doesn&#39;t really know us, but we&#39;ve been working on that and I think that we are making progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, here&#39;s a photo I took of our backyard swing while I was pushing our six year old on it. Enjoy. 😃&lt;/p&gt;

		  &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s certainly been a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And night, honestly. Late last night our eldest came home with his little one. I will say that it wasn&#39;t entirely unexpected, and that we as a family are glad to have them here. We are grateful that we are &lt;em&gt;able&lt;/em&gt; to have them here. This weekend will be a bit of work, as I have kinda taken over the extra room and made an office out of it, which will have to be swapped back over to make room for the two of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve also got a couple of us in the home who aren&#39;t exactly feeling all that well. One probably should have come home early with an ear infection/headache/head cold. Myself, I&#39;m halfway stopped up with a scratchy throat and can&#39;t sleep worth a darn. It&#39;s been a pretty not so fun time overall here in the household.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The twins have the last day of school tomorrow, assuming that they are both able to go. Next year they will be finishing up middle school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, I&#39;m just sitting here, listening to the quiet that is octonaughts. Who are also asking for peace and quiet. It&#39;s kinda meta.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>A somewhat productive day</title>

		  &lt;p&gt;If I were to be honest - and really why wouldn&#39;t I be so - today has been something of a productive day. I don&#39;t feel like I have a whole lot of &lt;em&gt;actual product&lt;/em&gt; that came out of today, but I do feel that I made some learning progress today for work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, my friends, is certainly positive. I&#39;m learning some working details of our new ticketing/asset/configuration item/project system. We&#39;re moving from the atlassian product, so it&#39;s something along those lines. I don&#39;t mind jira, but it&#39;ll be nice to not have different login system and be able to use our single sign on. Plus, while I will be a department admin, I don&#39;t have to admin the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was also the last day of school for the kindergartner and the fifth grader. It&#39;s bittersweet all around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it&#39;s a short update day.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>End of an era</title>

		  &lt;p&gt;Today was the recognition ceremony for our fifth grader. This is certainly a special class, one that we feel honored to have gotten to be involved with. Our fellow parents are amazing, our son&#39;s peer group is just flat out phenomenal, we couldn&#39;t ask for anything better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This class has marked a couple of milestones. First, the school principal started out with this group in kindergarten. She&#39;s been a wonderful person - an advocate above all who believes in all the students. Sadly for this school, she is leaving for another district.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, our young man has had a gifted IEP for a number of years now (recall what I said about the principal being an advocate?), and he was the first gifted student for his particular gifted facilitator. She, too, has been a joy to work with. We have had nothing but positive memories for this school and the people there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, we still have one more kiddo to take through this journey. He is getting to go through this school&#39;s beginning of a Montessori program. So far, it&#39;s been good for him. We would have loved to have had more of them go through this type of learning system, but at least one is able to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we first moved here, I admit to having doubts about this area and this school - but no longer.&lt;/p&gt;

		  &lt;p&gt;As the saying goes, &amp;quot;oh for crying out loud!&amp;quot; Not only have I/we not all been feeling too well, but last night my right eye began bothering me. It felt really dry, not super itchy or anything, just dry and a little hazy at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get up and look into the mirror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoa, that&#39;s certainly a red, rather angry looking eye I&#39;ve got there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, being a parent of five kiddos, there really is only one thing that goes through my head at this point, and I can&#39;t quite figure out how in the world I would have come down with &lt;em&gt;pink eye&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, we do have five kiddos (well, mostly four, though the first is back under the roof with his own as well now) in the house. Plus, we don&#39;t like to throw medication away. Or anything really, but that&#39;s another story. So I guess it&#39;s eye drops for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How I&#39;ve managed to go all my life without getting this before I&#39;ll never know. It&#39;s right up there with &lt;em&gt;how in the world did I get it this time?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So annoying.&lt;/p&gt;

		  &lt;p&gt;The 20th of the month, and the first time that I&#39;ve actually sat down at a computer to write a post in, oh, what seems like forever at this point. I&#39;ve remembered to &lt;code&gt;git pull --rebase&lt;/code&gt; so - hopefully - there won&#39;t be any errors thrown by git. What I&#39;ve not done is to come up with some kind of theme for todays entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning was pretty much blown, not only was there no real sleep to have been had (stopped up nasal situation, creating a wonderfully sore throat), but then there was the need to get the two oldest and the youngest kiddos in for their annual &amp;quot;well child&amp;quot; check. Always a good time. At least our family doctor is easy to talk to and we generally really like her. Would definitely recommend her as a local doc anytime I see people ask about who to go to in any of the local groups. The only thing that I (we...) don&#39;t care so much for is the fact that her practice was sucked up into the local hospital conglomerate a handful of years ago. Ugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;just-chillaxing-here&quot;&gt;Just chillaxing here &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#just-chillaxing-here&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I&#39;m just sitting here putting off one of the more dull parts of my duties. Instead of which, I&#39;m listening to my eldest twin talk his way through an attempted understanding of building a binary input system that outputs an analog number using simple logic gates. Not only has he basically taught this to himself (with a small amount of input from myself), but he has more or less sucessfully reversed engineered a simple prebuilt machine and added a third bit. Listening to him explain the process, and be super excited about his progress, is enough to make this geeky Dad very, very proud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve also been kind of halfway &lt;em&gt;futzing&lt;/em&gt; (that&#39;s a technical term there) around with creating a process to pull in a weeks worth of &lt;code&gt;raindrop.io&lt;/code&gt; links into distinct data directories within this blog. I&#39;ve got a pretty simple solution that will pull in the previous weeks worth of items, create any necessary &lt;code&gt;YYYY/MM&lt;/code&gt; directory, then write a &lt;code&gt;response.json&lt;/code&gt; file containing the items. I guess I&#39;d probably rather create &lt;em&gt;week number&lt;/em&gt; directories as opposed to month directories though - that would make more sense in that process. The idea being that I could have a weekly post of all the links that I wanted to save and share for that previous week. I also do use the paid &lt;a href=&quot;http://raindrop.io/&quot;&gt;raindrop.io&lt;/a&gt; account, so I think I could maybe link to the cache - not sure on that, though. At least for me, I could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past few days I&#39;ve also been trying to get more familier with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/&quot;&gt;Nyxt&lt;/a&gt; web browser. It&#39;s kind of an &lt;em&gt;on again, off again&lt;/em&gt; deal with me. Some of my browsing I do over an X tunnel, and nyxt just seems a little bit faster than firefox. Plus, it&#39;s &lt;code&gt;lisp&lt;/code&gt; based and I&#39;m still in that phase of learning new things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, I think we shall call it an end.&lt;/p&gt;

		  &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s Sunday, which thankfully means that the weekend is nearly, blessedly, over. One of these days I&#39;ll figure out what it is about the weekend or time off that I don&#39;t care for. Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managed to get the dishwasher unloaded and reloaded this morning. Sometimes I still feel very much like that butter robot. Only I get to do more than just &amp;quot;pass the butter&amp;quot;, I also get to fetch fresh paper towel rolls from storage! Aren&#39;t I lucky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that people don&#39;t take me for granted, but good grief sometimes it really does feel that way. Are there things in my life that I would haved changed, given the chance? Sure, I don&#39;t think that there is anybody out there that would say otherwise. I try to stay upbeat and somewhat optimistic, but it can be a challenge. Especially when you live with somebody who has depression. Anyhow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was going to write something here related to what I&#39;ve stated above, but I&#39;m not too sure that I want to get into some of these items just at this time. At least not in public. While I don&#39;t share these posts within my &lt;em&gt;close friend group&lt;/em&gt;, neither is this site exactly hidden. I think I&#39;ll just leave it at that for a bit. Talk about vague posting, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for an attempt at something a little less depressing I guess. While I really, really have been enjoying Zettel Notes, I would like a way to more easily share pics on this site. Without the need to host the images myself. Yeah, that kinda limits me with workflow simplicity. I&#39;ve got the pixelfed account, so there is that, but then omg.lol also has a pretty simple image host as well. Both just take a little extra steps. But this should work, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.some.pics/swrogers/664a23faee93d.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cropped picture of my IronFlask coffee mug.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess that should do for today.&lt;/p&gt;

		  &lt;p&gt;Ah, welcome to the weekend!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally was able to sleep in a bit this morning, all of until 8am. Still feels like sleeping half the morning away, though, especially when one is used to getting up at 6am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a Saturday it&#39;s been kinda productive, managed to get the lawn mowed for the first time in over a week. It&#39;s funny, when I was a kid and had to mow two yards and a large back lot I was never a fan of the chore. It could have had something to do with needing to deal with a black walnut tree....if you know, you know. Ugh. Now, though, it&#39;s a good time to unwind with some music and enjoy the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly it&#39;s not something that I&#39;d consider a chore. My yard doesn&#39;t look the best in the neighborhood, but at least it&#39;s far from the worst. I try to take at least a little bit of pride in how the home looks. It doesn&#39;t hurt that the neighbors also have really nice lawns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve got other things around the home that I&#39;d like to do - one of which being permanent holiday lighting with some programmable LEDs. Maybe I can tackle that project this Summer.&lt;/p&gt;

		  &lt;p&gt;I feel like I should have more to write about today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like I could (should?) have been more productive today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us count what all I&#39;ve accomplished to get done this fine, fine Friday the seventeenth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of our major SaaS applications is going to be upgraded at the end of the month, so that needed to be added to the calendar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A group request that I&#39;d made a couple of days ago was just fulfilled, so I was able to make a couple of updates in prep for a background process. Which can&#39;t be finished until a separate sync occurs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I brought an item to another groups attention, so that the requestor can be thought how to help themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&#39;ve started learning a new service management/issue tracker/asset management/knowledge base system of which I am one of the main admins for our group. This should be fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trying to pick up some Laravel. I don&#39;t know why or for what purpose, seeing as I actually prefer clojure for fun and....well, not really profit seeing as how it&#39;s a hobby.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that&#39;s about the gist of what I&#39;ve done today. I guess I did upgrade one of my Kimsufi boxes and portainer container. It&#39;s been a moderately full day, and for that I&#39;m completely okay!&lt;/p&gt;

		  &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s the afternoon and I&#39;m sitting in the car, waiting for the two youngest to get released from school. I can&#39;t complain about how the day has gone, it&#39;s been pretty good and relatively productive. I&#39;m just glad that the little one was able to go and stay at school all day! I love that my kids, generally, enjoy school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of my job role involves application upgrades for some decently large vendors, Oracle and Salesforce come to mind. These upgrades can be a tad kludgy. An understatement to say the least. I&#39;ve been through a handful of one upgrade in particular that I have been able to get documented fairly well, and I believe that I now have it down to, if not a science then at least an art. Art is still allowed to be messy - and this thing is no exception. I think my favorite part of this last patch cycle was that Oracle has evidently stopped providing (what appears to be) either a second copy of their jdk, or they&#39;ve streamlined it into a non-versioned directory. Which I suppose is nice. At least it was easy enough to sort out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve got some other projects in the hopper at work, and it feels good to be a part of them. It almost feels like progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, the kids are picked up. Some garlic olives have been snacked on (it is weird how ones tastes change when away from carbohydrates for so long). I&#39;m sure I could ramble on more, but I think I&#39;m good here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading, if you are. If you&#39;re not, then that&#39;s okay too.&lt;/p&gt;

		  &lt;p&gt;We seem to be nearing the midway point of the month. I am just getting back to work from a week of &amp;quot;vacation&amp;quot;, then two days of having a sick kiddo at home. Okay, so three days, really, but today has been more of a &amp;quot;letting the kiddo keep his temp normal&amp;quot; kinda day. Not so much sick, as he is stopped up. At least the cough is more or less done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is the way of things, after taking a week off of work today has basically been spent playing catch-up. At least it hasn&#39;t been as bad as it&#39;s been in the past. Just a couple of quick answers that needed to be sent out. I&#39;m so glad this is a slower time of year. I&#39;ve generally taken two weeks off at a time, but figured I&#39;d change things up this go round. Of course, what with the sick kiddo I was beginning to wonder if I might have wound up taking this week off as sick leave too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-lifestyle&quot;&gt;The lifestyle &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#the-lifestyle&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about an update on my keto life? My weight has been steadily creeping up over that 190 plus mark over the past few months. Certainly not where I want to be, no matter what other people in my life think. While I do agree that sub 170 is not a good look on me, I continue to struggle with making my way down below 190. I still have my goal at 182, preferably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do consider myself lucky (accomplished?) in that I still wear the same sized jeans and clothes, so I haven&#39;t had to change or modify the wardrobe again. Thankfully. That&#39;s one of my major fears, that whole idea of relapse, once I were to allow myself to get comfortable with a weight. When that happens, then I stop logging all food, I start snacking more, I start thinking that eating this little bit of junk is going to be okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it&#39;s just a completely blown day and I wanna retreat within myself. I need to be able to string together a few good days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need this win, again.&lt;/p&gt;

		  &lt;p&gt;Two weeks in, so far so good?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that is certainly a bonus when participating in a weblog writing challenge is that one may just happen upon some other interesting writers or posts. Which is, I suppose, one of the reasons the challenge even exists. There have been multiple reasons - excuses really - for why I&#39;ve never done much writing for myself, the least of which being my internal thought that &lt;em&gt;I have nothing of interest for anyone to read&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, but really though, is that the sole reason to write? No. I should write for myself, no matter how mundane I think the entry of the day will be. Have I been taking care of a child with a racking cough, who rends at my heart because there just isn&#39;t much that I can do for him? Yep, so I should write about that. Was I finally able to get some yardwork done because the incessant rain finally stopped? Yep, note it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why shouldn&#39;t I go on and just use a blog as a daily journal. It takes zero effort at this point and it&#39;s for my own good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those that might be interested, including future me, &lt;a href=&quot;https://brandons-journal.com/post/shame-and-blogging-redux&quot;&gt;here is the post that sparked&lt;/a&gt; this entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s still early, so there may be more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;awards-and-stuff&quot;&gt;Awards and stuff &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#awards-and-stuff&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As parents we love to brag on our children. With five excellent young kiddos, I have no limit to the amount of praise that can be levied. Today has been no exception. We just returned from the fifth grader&#39;s surprise award presentation, where he received an Unsung Hero award from a local group. They choose two young students each year to honor, and we were pleasantly surprised when we found out he was chosen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our kids are absolutely amazing and I look forward to seeing what they are able to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;

		  &lt;p&gt;Lucky number thirteen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn&#39;t too certain that I was going to make this one, if I were to be completely honest. It&#39;s been a day full of watching a sick kiddo and trying to keep myself in check as well. To say that it has not been a great day would be an understatement at the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve had a couple of really long nights, as our youngest has been making his way into our room (which is not so different from the normal) and coughing up a storm (which is different from the norm). Hopefully he&#39;ll be able to get this thing beat soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will say that I&#39;m lucky in that my job is very flexible in allowing us to e to care for family and self. I know that not everyone is so fortunate. For that, I am thankful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, I have finally been able to watch &lt;strong&gt;Dune Part Two&lt;/strong&gt;, which was excellent. I had really wanted to see it in a theater but was never able to make it. The first &lt;strong&gt;Dune&lt;/strong&gt; was actually the he first movie I saw in the theater after the world had began to open back up. Some might say post COVID, but I think that we all know we are still current COVID. Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These entries have been good for just getting my mind settled and thawed out for the day. While nowhere near what I had intended to write about, I hope to be able to continue on this path. Whether anyone reads them or not, matters not to me.&lt;/p&gt;

		  &lt;p&gt;Today is the twelfth of May. The last day of my vacation, yet another vacation where absolutely nothing was accomplished. I&#39;d feel bad, but I generally don&#39;t get much done on these things. Who wants to work on their vacations. Normally I&#39;d take a pair of weeks off, which would at least enable me to sorta almost get something done during the second week. But not this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m sitting here at someone&#39;s home, of whom I have no idea who they are. Well, I guess it&#39;s a home, more a ranch. It&#39;s a really nice place. But, even then it&#39;s one of those deals where I don&#39;t know anyone here and really don&#39;t have much of a connection with anyone. All I can say and think is, &lt;em&gt;man, I couldn&#39;t even fathom owning this much land or this kind of property&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully we aren&#39;t going to be here long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;four-hours-later&quot;&gt;Four Hours Later &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#four-hours-later&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give or take. It&#39;s after dinner, so it&#39;s time to catch up on some entertainment. Today it&#39;s &lt;strong&gt;Dead Boy Detectives&lt;/strong&gt;. I seem to recall something about a possible spin off of these characters with an episode of &lt;strong&gt;Doom Patrol&lt;/strong&gt;, but I could be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far it&#39;s pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, &lt;em&gt;Happy Mother&#39;s Day&lt;/em&gt; to those that celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Junk Food For Thought</title>

		  &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s the eleventh of May. Saturday. A day to do not a whole lot. Same as tomorrow I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been trying for most of the day to come up with some kind of theme for todays post. I guess it&#39;s been staring me in the face for the day as well, if only I could open the proverbial eyes. It has actually been making its path through my hands, in front of my face and down the old gullet multiple times today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s kind of funny, what is one person&#39;s junk food is not the same as every body else&#39;s junk food. What was junk food for me me years ago is completely off limits to me now, nor do I crave those items now. Thankfully. Today, my junk food is stuff like cheese, natural peanut butter, macadamia nuts. All high calorie stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we first started keto, I thought that must difficult things to give to would be all the baked goods: cookies, biscuits, cakes, etc. I mentally gamed it, though, and was able to conquer those cravings. My first hump was getting past 220 and into the so-called &lt;em&gt;one-derland&lt;/em&gt;. Now, that I&#39;ve been past there, into the 170s, my new plateau is trying to get back below 180. I&#39;ve continued to be in the 190s for longer than I like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really need to get back into that track, stop snacking, get away from the peanut butter and dairy, start tracking everything that goes on my plate once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve started not feeling my best. I need to get there once again.&lt;/p&gt;

		  &lt;p&gt;My original idea for this month, the challenge of posting a &amp;quot;simple&amp;quot; blog post each day, was to have myself read the &amp;quot;Writing to Learn&amp;quot; book and then give my thoughts on what I had read. This far, I have only succeeded at half of that challenge, having not really made much progress in the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do say that I&#39;m not really all that surprised. I did take this week off of work, so did my spouse. Therefore I just don&#39;t really have much in the way of a desire to sit, read and contemplate. What o have been able to do, though, in stealing away a few bits of time here and there to write, has been of good use. It&#39;s been not quite cathartic, but very close, to get words out of my head and onto the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning was field day for the fifth grader. We signed up to assist the teachers with attempting to keep the students under some kind of control. Basically just ensuring that they didn&#39;t maim each other. I had myself stationed at what I&#39;ll refer to as the &lt;em&gt;sponge fighting&lt;/em&gt; location. One of the handful of water areas that are set up. The idea here being that the kids pair up and toss a sopping wet sponge back and forth. If you can&#39;t catch the sponge, then you wring it out over your head. It&#39;s all good fun. It all more or less kind of devolves into &amp;quot;let&#39;s just throw wet sponges at each other!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We go back shortly to help out with the Montessori primary group - the kindergartners. It should be a lot of fun. Our six year old is very excited to have us there with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight is another performance, as well. The twins have the last major show for honor choir, which the class has been working towards for some time now. After that, then then of school. It&#39;s crazy, how quickly this year has gone by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will soon be midsummer. Then it&#39;ll be turkey day. Then new years. Then...&lt;/p&gt;

		  &lt;p&gt;I think that I&#39;ve come to where I would much rather be working. Work is enjoyable, vacations are nothing but just waiting to to back to work. It&#39;s not so much a dread for the end of the vacation, but just knowing that I never am able to accomplish what I would like to do during the time away from work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that I&#39;m disparaging the vacation. I&#39;m equal opportunity when it comes to not being a fan of not working, I&#39;m not really big on weekends either. Granted I&#39;d probably to absolutely insane if I did nothing but work. One has to have some time off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where I work, we get plenty of paid leave to earn. Eight hours per every Eighty hour work period, up to a maximum of 304 hours. Of which I am routinely butted up against. Plus, a discretionary holiday. I really should take more time for myself, I&#39;m told multiple times by multiple people that I should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, alas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current question then becomes, do I feel that anything has been accomplished during this break. There was some yardwork done. The car was washed, by hand, even! I may have gotten the yard mowed once. It just always feels like there is something that needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meh.&lt;/p&gt;

		  &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s the eighth day of the month. I got to drop the older two boys off for zero hour honor choir a little early this morning, 6:50AM instead of 7:00AM. One wouldn&#39;t think that 10 minutes would make much of a difference, but it certainly can. We did get there in time, so yay. Of course, for me just being some place &lt;em&gt;on time&lt;/em&gt; actually means that &lt;em&gt;I&#39;m late&lt;/em&gt;. Now, if I could only get my spouse to adhere to that philosophy. 😂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning, and tomorrow morning, will both be basically the same. The twins have a music performance on Friday that is the big finale for the year. Tonight we also have a band concert for one of them. Like I said the other day, it&#39;s gonna be a full week. It &lt;em&gt;has been&lt;/em&gt; a full week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;mobile-editing&quot;&gt;Mobile editing &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#mobile-editing&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I may have finally found a decent markdown editor that can sync with my git blog repo: &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.eu.thedoc.zettelnotes&quot;&gt;Zettel Notes&lt;/a&gt;. Well, sure, there have been others that can sync and work, but I think I really prefer this one for some reason. Probably because it can actually move files around when requested as opposed to copying them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the only thing that I would like to be able to do from mobile (apart from easier photo uploads, but someday maybe) would be running the eleventy test server. Other than that, I&#39;m pretty content with what&#39;s available now.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>And on the seventh day</title>

		  &lt;p&gt;Aye, and on the seventh day yet another post has appeared! We are coming up on the end of another school year for our kids, another year that continues to speed on past us. The next few weeks are going to be very full of events. Along with the full schedules, comes special types of stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stress. Along with most people, I would imagine, I am not a fan. Some people stress eat, thankfully I am not one of those. I eat out of boredom. At least this is something that I am aware of. I&#39;ve been trying to eat better for a handful of years now, some would say successfully. My wife and myself opted to go the ketogenic journey and I have kept a out 145 pounds off my frame for some time now. Three thirty plus to one eighty five, give or take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so where am I going in all of this rambling? As I get older, as I watch my kids grow into greater ages, I made a decision that I wanted to see them get older. I knew that if I had continued on in the direction that I was going, that I&#39;d be in a grave within very little time. I have no doubt that I have avoided diabetes and at least taken one foot off of the banana peel, so to speak. Not to mention feeling much better and, hopefully, modeling a healthier behavior for my children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No rest for myself on this day, though. The second day of my vacation and I&#39;ve done little to nothing that I would like to get done. Ah, but then who really wants to do pre-spring cleaning on their vacations.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>A day of waxing philosophically</title>

		<content type="html">
		  &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s day the next around these parts. For whatever that means, right? I&#39;ve not made nearly the progress on my book that I&#39;d like to, so today&#39;s entry will be another one of those &amp;quot;day in the life of&amp;quot; ordeals. I might even be able to make this interesting, but I wouldn&#39;t let odds down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I turn 47. Not quite the same as when one turns 40, though let&#39;s be honest here, I don&#39;t think my 40th was anything all that spectacular. Nor is it quite the same as turning 50, I&#39;m guessing. As I get older and watch my kids get older, I can&#39;t help but think that it really wasn&#39;t all that much long ago that I was their age, almost in their shoes, going through similar phases. I&#39;ve tried to do my absolute best buy my kids. My Dad, who I love, has probably told me that he loves me only a handful of times. I know he does, but I&#39;ve tried to reverse that trend with my boys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think back to some of the points in my life, I try to correlate how old my kiddo&#39;s are, to how old I was, to how old my Dad was (or, would have been at that time). I always wonder what would have been going through his mind. It&#39;s just strange, trying to put myself into his place. There are differences between the two of us, there is no doubt there. As parents, we try to ensure that our children have access to things that we never had - or, in my case things that I never knew that I should have or would have wanted. Things as simple as high school yearbooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&#39;t go to a large high school, nor did I have an over abundance of friends, nor did I ever think that I would want to ever reminisce about those years of my life. Of course, growing up I think I must have thought that yearbooks just magically showed up at school on yearbook signing day. It never would have occurred to me that there was an (at times) significant cost involved. My kids may not realize it now, but they&#39;ll be thankful for those, at least, in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, we love our kids and want the best for them. Though, what parent does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, with that I think we shall close out this day.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>It&#39;s the fifth day</title>
		<link href="https://shanewrogers.lol/posts/it&amp;#39;s-the-fifth-day/"/>

		  &lt;p&gt;This is the fifth day of the challenge! Yesterday was an attempt to post something using the GitJournal app, which sort of worked, but didn&#39;t work quite as smoothly as one would have liked. It failed to save the new file in the appropriate folder, though I&#39;m fairly certain I saved it where it needed. Then when trying to move it, it does a copy instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which plays havoc with the push to git and the workflow run. Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in my attempt to both come up with a post today &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; perhaps a decent mobile way to post, today is just straight into the github web site and add a new post. Is it preferable? Absolutely not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news today, I was able to get the yard mowed before it rained. I&#39;ve got this feeling that for the next month or so it&#39;s basically going to be &amp;quot;mow whenever you flippin&#39; can&amp;quot;. Otherwise, my old battery operated Snapper just - literally - isn&#39;t going to cut it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, off to the store. Tonight is homemade tomato soup and grilled cheese with smoked gouda. Perhaps a tasty antipasto salad as well.&lt;/p&gt;

		  &lt;p&gt;Here we are at day for during this monthly challenge. The next couple of days are going to be the first two that present as very difficult for me - will I be able to get something posted during the weekend, while the home is filled with family and kids and I would rather &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be dealing with a computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in that case, I am not using a computer or laptop for the post. Instead I&#39;m seeing how well the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitjournal.io/&quot;&gt;GitJournal&lt;/a&gt; app works on my phone. I don&#39;t really have any other content management system set up here, so this really needs to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe this would be a good excuse to set up a Ghost CMS for the front end. Probably not, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve done no reading today, so that&#39;s a negative. I did check out the Samurai Jack series from the local library, I&#39;m looking forward to giving that a watch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that....till next time.&lt;/p&gt;

		  &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s day three of Weblog Posting Month 2024!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whew!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll be honest, I was beginning to wonder if I was going to make it today. Today has been challenging, to say the least, so I will be putting off today&#39;s reading of the &amp;quot;Writing to Learn&amp;quot; book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why is that?&amp;quot; - I hear absolutely noone asking. Well, I&#39;ll tell you anyhow. I do much of my blog posting through &lt;code&gt;emacs&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;code&gt;org-mode&lt;/code&gt; capture templates. My current &lt;code&gt;emacs&lt;/code&gt; configuration is a semi modified &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs&quot;&gt;doom emacs&lt;/a&gt; build which has worked very well for me in the past and continues to do so in the present. Generally. I don&#39;t know if I had some kind of hardware issue (which is possible, as my config is hosted on a local NAS with used drives) due to perhaps a recent storm, but my org capture templates were just not working at all. Even after a &lt;code&gt;doom doctor&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;doom purge&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;doom build&lt;/code&gt; cycle...nothing worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which necessitated a &lt;em&gt;nuclear option&lt;/em&gt; of a fresh git checkout of doom and starting over. It&#39;s not really a complete do over, though, since I still have my private/personal doom init files that live in a different directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, after about an hour and ten minutes of waiting for the build process to finish (ugh...) we are back to par. Yippee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-actual-challenge&quot;&gt;The actual challenge &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#the-actual-challenge&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything stated, I have actually read a bit of the next chapter, and all of the above was initiated because I wanted to take a handful of notes. One item in particular, about clear writing being evidence of clear thinking. Something of which I really need to strive to do - think clearly. With that, and just a little bit of focus, perhaps I can write clearly.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Another Day, Another Chapter. Day Two.</title>
		<link href="https://shanewrogers.lol/posts/another-day-another-chapter.-day-two./"/>
		<updated>2024-05-02T14:00:56+00:00</updated>
		<id>https://shanewrogers.lol/posts/another-day-another-chapter.-day-two./</id>
		<content type="html">
		  &lt;p&gt;The second day brings with it a second chapter of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.harpercollins.com/products/writing-to-learn-william-zinsser?variant=42347013505058&quot;&gt;Writing To Learn&lt;/a&gt; book. To be completely fair, I had read about half of this yesterday and have finished it up this morning. To be even more fair, it will be highly probable that I&#39;ll read chapter 3 and add more to this post today as well. Let us find out what has been digested this go round, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;gustavus-adolphus-college&quot;&gt;Gustavus Adolphus College &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#gustavus-adolphus-college&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right out of the gate I learned something. While even the author, Zinsser, did believe that everybody should be able to write - he did literally write the book on the subject - the idea of &lt;em&gt;Writing Across the Curriculum&lt;/em&gt; came from the small Midwestern College of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustavus_Adolphus_College&quot;&gt;Gustavus Adolphus&lt;/a&gt;. Or, at least as well as I can tell according to the text. Even at that point in history (jeeze, only 1985) the professors had a need and a want to move the responsibility of teaching students to write away from the &amp;quot;English&amp;quot; Department. Which makes complete sense to me. We write - or should write - about more than just, well, previously written materials (books, plays, what have you). Noted within this chapter are numerous other great sources of written material - from beautiful mathematic proofs, to how the periodic table of the elements are arranged and why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-puzzle-of-the-humanities&quot;&gt;A puzzle of the humanities &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#a-puzzle-of-the-humanities&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting point was brought up during my reading today. If one&#39;s mind likes to work though puzzles, finding solutions to whatever has been presented to you, then perhaps no matter what the subject matter is it could be possible to find an intriguing route to write about said solution. As an example, the author has noted multiple times that they did not care for chemistry in school. Maybe if some of the work had been phrased the way that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitri_Mendeleev&quot;&gt;D I Mendeleev&lt;/a&gt; had worked out the &lt;em&gt;Periodic Law&lt;/em&gt; and creating a version of the &lt;em&gt;Period Table of the Elements&lt;/em&gt;, then that challenge would have had a more positive effect on him. If there is some way to find a human element to whatever subject matter is being studied or written about, that seems to help a great deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-feeling-of-rambling&quot;&gt;A feeling of rambling &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#a-feeling-of-rambling&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m doing it again - I feel like I&#39;m just kind of rambling on. I should tighten this stuff up. Meh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us finish up with a couple of quotes from the chapter that have kind of stuck with me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students should be learning a strong and unpretentious prose that will carry their thoughts about the world they live in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...every subject is interesting if an avenue into it can be found that has humanity and that an ordinary person can follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These ring well with me. I&#39;m no journalist, no professional writer for sure. But I have read a wide variety of subjects, books, magazines, articles...those that leave the best impression are of the style that don&#39;t belittle or &amp;quot;talk down&amp;quot; to the reader. I find it sad that today we are losing a large amount of written work that may never be. Amazing magazines that have stopped printing. Journals that are no longer around. Yes, I am aware of the irony that any readers of this material are doing so on a media that involves a screen. It&#39;s easier, but only in so many ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge is finding it.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Writing to learn - Weblog Posting Month 2024</title>
		<link href="https://shanewrogers.lol/posts/writing-to-learn-weblog-posting-month-2024/"/>
		<updated>2024-05-01T16:19:52+00:00</updated>
		<id>https://shanewrogers.lol/posts/writing-to-learn-weblog-posting-month-2024/</id>
		<content type="html">
		  &lt;p&gt;Well it&#39;s finally here: my first entry into Annie&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/weblog-posting-month-2024&quot;&gt;Weblog PoMo 2024&lt;/a&gt;. As with most things that I do when it comes to writing, I haven&#39;t really planned this out. Does that mean that I&#39;m most likely going to fail at it? That is a definite possibility. But I&#39;m willing to at least give it a shot for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there is nothing like getting an &lt;a href=&quot;https://echofeed.app/&quot;&gt;Echofeed&lt;/a&gt; set up for it to help with some accountability - up to and including having the &lt;a href=&quot;https://beep.town/@echofeedamplify&quot;&gt;Amplify Bot&lt;/a&gt; boost your stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that out of the way, let&#39;s get the ball rolling on &lt;a href=&quot;https://shanewrogers.lol/tags/weblogpomo2024&quot;&gt;#weblogpomo2024&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;writing-to-learn&quot;&gt;Writing to learn &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#writing-to-learn&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or something like that. Writing to learn, writing to keep yourself accountable, whatever the reason it&#39;s a good skill to have. It&#39;s not necessarily something that one actually appreciates when they are younger. I graduated high school in 1995 and was fortunate enough to have had a couple of college level courses that we were able to take during our senior year - including an English course that included at least one paper. It was a great start on my college and university stint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I did eventually enroll and find myself in college, part of our curriculum was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_across_the_curriculum&quot;&gt;Writing to learn&lt;/a&gt; selection of courses - I believe that we needed required to take two or three of these. The idea - at the time at least - was something that I can&#39;t say I was too overly fond of. I was going to be a Computer Science major and didn&#39;t feel that I needed to &amp;quot;Write to Learn&amp;quot;. Of course, I did though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wouldn&#39;t be until much, &lt;strong&gt;much&lt;/strong&gt; later that I would find the source of this sound reasoning: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.harpercollins.com/products/writing-to-learn-william-zinsser?variant=42347013505058&quot;&gt;William Zinsser&#39;s Book&lt;/a&gt;. At least, I assume this to be the source. My plan, my goal, is to actually read this book. I don&#39;t think it to be too much to ask. I&#39;ve already got one chapter down and I find that I really like the flow and the style. So, part of what I write about this month is going to include some of my thoughts on the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&#39;t going to be some great article series, no doubt about that. But I do hope that I&#39;m able to improve a bit on my writing, maybe it can even become a habit to write more. I don&#39;t think I could hope to be able to write &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;, I find that I&#39;m pretty well stuck in my ways on that account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will end this entry with a bit of an anecdote. Not long after I moved to Lawrence, I found myself sitting at a local restaurant eating a meal. Behind me sat a couple of who I will assume to be professors from the university and they were having a conversation. The subject of students not knowing how to write papers came up, which was kind of a surprise to me. This was quite some time ago, but from what I can recall I do remember thinking to myself how sad and disturbing that was. How could students in this (that?) day and age make it through high school and into college or university and not know how to write?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can only imagine that now, it&#39;s a problem that has not gotten any better. Writing is becoming a lost art it seems.&lt;/p&gt;

		  &lt;p&gt;I think I&#39;m going to try to do something that will be very difficult for me. I&#39;ve decided to join the group in a &lt;em&gt;post every day during the month of May&lt;/em&gt; challenge that has been dubbed &lt;a href=&quot;https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/weblog-posting-month-2024&quot;&gt;#WeblogPoMo2024&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shall be using the same tag here, &lt;a href=&quot;https://shanewrogers.lol/tags/weblogpomo2024&quot;&gt;as well&lt;/a&gt; for sake of categorization. I guess it&#39;s likely  that I&#39;ll even start using the echo feed account that I&#39;ve been paying for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll see how this goes. I was able to do the &amp;quot;post a photo every day for 30 days&amp;quot; thing over on microblog to get that badge, which wasn&#39;t super easy for me either.&lt;/p&gt;
