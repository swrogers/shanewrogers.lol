Ha.</p>\n<p>Last week I did go ahead and get a pre-order in for <a href=\"https://io.mwl.io/@mwl\">Michael W Lucas'</a> new book on <em>Run Your Own Mail Server</em>. The ebook has already been delivered and I'm very much looking forward to flipping through the paperback when it arrives.

Although it didn't actually make much of a difference in the distance, very negligible.</p>\n<p>Anyhow. That's what I've got, I think I've worked on this entry long enough now.

Whatever that something might be.</p>\n<p>Whether it's putting myself out there when looking for employment, for example, I have that fear not of <em>what if I get denied</em> but of <em>what if I get approved?</em></p>\n<p>Then there are social situations. This might, or might not, have just as much to do with being introverted as well, though.</p>\n<p>Let us say that I were to go looking for some kind of connection. Platonic or otherwise, it makes no matter. Frankly, I'm terrible at small talk. I've been told that I'm a competent communicator, but that's not necessarily for me to decide.</p>\n<p>I don't know how to make friends any more. It's tough.</p>\n<h3 id=\"item-the-second\">Item the second <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#item-the-second\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I have never been competitive.</p>\n<p>Ever.</p>\n<p>I was basically forced into playing team sports when I was a kid (granted, T-ball was fun - ha). Baseball. Basketball. Football.</p>\n<p>I could actually pitch with either left or right handed. Couldn't do it now to save my life, but it was a thing I was capable of.</p>\n<p>I never liked any of it though.</p>\n<p>Probably didn't help that all of the teams I was on stunk. But that's not relevant.</p>\n<p>I was able to come to the conclusion the other day that the only person I compete with, in any way, is myself.</p>\n<p>And it does not allow me to relax. Ever.</p>\n<p>Take keto, for example. When we started on keto five years ago I dove into the deep end. Got an app and basically <em>gamed the heck out of it</em>. I would try to see just how few carbs I could do compared to all the other users of the app. Routinely I fell into the top tier and could easily go less than 5 to 7 net carbs a day. Logging everything.</p>\n<p>I would go to sleep at night super stoked to get up in morning to see how much weight has fallen off. Quite often it would be a pound or so.</p>\n<p>Was it safe? Not really. But it was my addiction, that self competition.</p>\n<p>Another example would be when I take my noon walks.</p>\n<p>I would imagine that when most people take walks it helps to clear their minds for the time ahead.</p>\n<p>Yeah, that's not how my head works.</p>\n<p>My oh my how I wish it did.</p>\n<p>Nope, I have this constant beat that runs through my mind: <em>one, two, three, four, one, two...</em> On and on and on.</p>\n<p>I have the need to push myself, quicker and quicker. Finish strong! I tell myself.</p>\n<p>I matters not if I've got music in my ears or listening to an NPR podcast. Same story.</p>\n<p>Why can't I just relax?</p>\n<p>This is post 29/100 of my #100DaysToOffload posts. You can read the other posts in this series <a href=\"/tags/100daystooffload\">here</a>.</p>\n",

Not so much the keto part, per se, so much as the amount of calories that I haven't been logging and keeping account of.</p>\n<p>In other words, snacking.</p>\n<p>I was standing in the kitchen earlier today, having toasted a slice of &quot;keto friendly&quot; bread (the heel, if you're curious), buttered and cinnamon &quot;sugar&quot; topped....and stared at it.</p>\n<p>I took a bit of a pause at that moment: <em>did I really want to eat this</em>? I've gone from thinking that I could easily do a 24 hour fast (perhaps even going longer for more frequent timing), to this undesirable feeling that I've got to snack.</p>\n<p>It's not even that I feel hungry.</p>\n<p>I used to eat out of boredom, maybe that's what I'm going back to? I need to get back in the game, my head is just a bit on the spacey side.</p>\n<p>I need to be able to look in the mirror again and be proud of what I've accomplished.</p>\n<p>It's a strange feeling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-the-world-of-work\">In the world of work <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#in-the-world-of-work\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I was able to get one new task taken care of earlier today.

Not that they don't always have, or that they won't always have two grades between them. Sometimes we forget that the youngest of these three is the <em>youngest</em> of the three - this kiddo has seemed for some time now to be the more mature of them all. Always a surprise to me and also I must admit that I am not overly certain that I am deserving of such amazing children.</p>\n<p>One of the twins will be spending the first part of some days at another school taking higher level math courses. Similar to what the youngest kiddo was going through last year, when he bussed from the elementary school to the middle school for his math course. I am more scared for the elder twin, though, than I was for the younger brother. Probably has to do with the fact he'll be going into a High School, opposed to a middle school.</p>\n<p>I think that everybody will do fine, but as a parent I think I'm allowed to feel that fear for my kiddo.</p>\n<p>We also find ourselves near the time of open enrollment for insurance.</p>\n<p>This year, I'm definitely looking forward to making some changes there. My wife has recently - this is her third week - started working at the same employer as I. Which means that we'll get to save a not insignificant amount of money on insurance! She will take over her own insurance plan and payment, using the same provider. I will continue to cover the kids and myself.

I'm attempting to get my mindset back into the keto game. That doesn't mean that I haven't continued to remain in the keto lifestyle all this time - I have. What I've not done is be more strict/stringent on logging everything I consume, which leads to laziness and unnecessary snacking.</p>\n<p>My weight is slowly sneaking up past that 190 pound entry, way too close to 200 for my taste. Things are not helped along by the fact that we have too much prepackaged junk in the house, sugar free slash keto &quot;friendly&quot; or not. I shall be getting back on that wagon, full speed.</p>\n<p>This is post 21/100 of my #100DaysToOffload posts.

This gutted me.</p>\n<p>Completely.</p>\n<p>These days, as I attempt to go through a boatload of boxes, I just have to ask myself: Why would you bring bits and pieces of this stuff, and not the actual decks that make these things work?!</p>\n<p>Gah!</p>\n<p>This is post 19/100 of my #100DaysToOffload posts.

It always felt a little hypocritical of myself when I did this. There I sat, three hundred thirty plus pounds, knowing that I would never be able to be one of those with a success story of my own.</p>\n<p>Within weeks of starting keto, I knew that I wanted nothing more than to just be down a hundred pounds after one year.</p>\n<p>Well, I like to say that I basically turned that whole change into a game: how large of a calorie restriction could I maintain, how close to zero net carbs could I average?</p>\n<p>I blew way past that hundred pounds loss within that year and was already very close to my current weight already.</p>\n<p>My lowest weight was in the 168 pound ballpark. I'm a six foot two plus guy, and I know for a fact that that was too low. I did not look good.</p>\n<p>I have slowly worked back up to low 190s. Insofar as health goes, I know that's perfectly acceptable.</p>\n<p>But. Mentally, it is not good enough for me. I want 180s. For my mind, where I'm at is just too close to 200. I don't want to be there again.</p>\n<p>So, I know that I dropped the weight (I don't like to say I <em>lost</em> it, because I really don't want to <em>find</em> it again) really quickly. Probably not super healthily either. However, I have managed in many ways to change my relationship with food.</p>\n<p>I never really ate my feelings. It was more out of boredom than anything. Now, I really try to enjoy the feeling of looking better and use the extra time to read or work on some other self development process.</p>\n<p>If I have missed anything at all during this life change, it's that my hair is no longer thick and composed of ringlets (think Weird Al hair). That's about the only thing I miss. But, it could be age related as well.</p>\n<p>Today has been a good day, thus far, when it comes to food.

One of the really cool things that our district provides (well, free it isn't...but it's available) is for incoming junior high students the opportunity to try out a variety of band and orchestra instruments over the course of four days, to see what they like.</p>\n<p>All of our kids have participated at this point, the current kiddo just finished his stint up. He went into it grudgingly, steadfast in his thinking that he just wanted to play the violin and nothing else. We did find out, through the whole camp experience, that he is not able to play brass - kiddo was just not able to buzz his lips. That's perfectly acceptable.</p>\n<p>Two of the instrument styles, both I suppose would be woodwinds, he actually played very well. Clarinet and flute. Totally hilarious, especially when considering that he really, <strong>really</strong>, did not want to go those days because he would just not be able to do anything at all with them. Ha.</p>\n<p>Even when all was said and done, what was his top choice? Well, still the violin. Totally cool. That said, his second choice was actually the flute. The actually also recommended that he try to choose the bass, he checked all the &quot;hell yeahs!&quot; on that one. Both the teacher that he worked with on bass, and  the assistant, were former bass players and were very excited to see how well he performed. Fortunately, those skills do translate well to the violin.</p>\n<p>All in all, we should now have half of a string quartet in our home now.</p>\n",

My parents probably loved each other, at one point, but if they did I never saw proof of that. Quite the opposite, actually. My parents divorced early in my life.</p>\n<p>I can remember only twice in my life - I'm currently nearly 50 years old at this point - that I witnessed my father cry. The first time I was probably still in the fourth grade (I'm wildly guessing here at timeframes) and it was early morning before school. I'm sitting at the dining room table (we actually had one of those, both the dining room and the table, quite the concept) eating breakfast and the question is put to me: &quot;Would you rather stay with your Mom or your Dad?&quot;.</p>\n<p>For the love of pete, what a question to drop on a young kid.</p>\n<p>What would you expect the response to be? If the kid leaves, then he has to change everything: schools, friends, homes, the whole bag.</p>\n<p>Of course the kid is going to opt stay with the Mom.</p>\n<p>Which I did, at that time.</p>\n<p>That was the first time witnessing the tears.</p>\n<p>My Mom was, quite likely, bi-polar. I think she even said that at one point that she'd been diagnosed, but I'm not positive. Some days were great, some not so great.</p>\n<p>I can remember a lot of volitility. Dishes, utensils, pots, pans, all being thrown out of the kitchen and at the wall in the hall.</p>\n<p>There was a time when I snuck into the kitchen one afternoon and grabbed a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie. Oh, I can tell you right now that I <strong>never</strong> did that again. I had a wooden mixing spoon broken across my backside for that one. I would have to say, I don't believe that punishment fit that crime.</p>\n<p>Then there was the time when my Mom was supposed to give me swats with a flyswatter. For some reason, she just barely tapped my bare bottom with said swatter. I don't know what I had done to deserve (or not, such as the case may have been) that one.</p>\n<p>I didn't spend much time with my Mother. I did wind up staying with my Dad. I know that they both loved me, but neither of them were very good at showing said love.</p>\n<p>Did I yearn for their attention? No. I can't say that I did.</p>\n<p>Has that history made my current life and years difficult? Oh, I think that's safe to say. I can't let people get close. I'm not one for really showing affection. I am emphatic and I do understand when others are going through difficulties, but I'm not really equipped to help necessarily.</p>\n",

So, not looking forward to that damage.</p>\n<p>Another item, which was actually positive, is that the Uber sectional super rearrangeable couch that we purchased showed up (mostly) today.

Our fellow parents are amazing, our son's peer group is just flat out phenomenal, we couldn't ask for anything better.</p>\n<p>This class has marked a couple of milestones. First, the school principal started out with this group in kindergarten. She's been a wonderful person - an advocate above all who believes in all the students. Sadly for this school, she is leaving for another district.</p>\n<p>Second, our young man has had a gifted IEP for a number of years now (recall what I said about the principal being an advocate?), and he was the first gifted student for his particular gifted facilitator. She, too, has been a joy to work with. We have had nothing but positive memories for this school and the people there.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, we still have one more kiddo to take through this journey. He is getting to go through this school's beginning of a Montessori program. So far, it's been good for him. We would have loved to have had more of them go through this type of learning system, but at least one is able to.</p>\n<p>When we first moved here, I admit to having doubts about this area and this school - but no longer.</p>\n<p>Wanna read my other <a href=\"/tags/weblogpomo2024\">#weblogpomo2024</a> posts?</p>\n",

I've remembered to <code>git pull --rebase</code> so - hopefully - there won't be any errors thrown by git. What I've not done is to come up with some kind of theme for todays entry.</p>\n<p>The morning was pretty much blown, not only was there no real sleep to have been had (stopped up nasal situation, creating a wonderfully sore throat), but then there was the need to get the two oldest and the youngest kiddos in for their annual &quot;well child&quot; check. Always a good time. At least our family doctor is easy to talk to and we generally really like her. Would definitely recommend her as a local doc anytime I see people ask about who to go to in any of the local groups. The only thing that I (we...) don't care so much for is the fact that her practice was sucked up into the local hospital conglomerate a handful of years ago. Ugh.</p>\n<h3 id=\"just-chillaxing-here\">Just chillaxing here <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#just-chillaxing-here\">#</a></h3>\n<p>So, I'm just sitting here putting off one of the more dull parts of my duties. Instead of which, I'm listening to my eldest twin talk his way through an attempted understanding of building a binary input system that outputs an analog number using simple logic gates. Not only has he basically taught this to himself (with a small amount of input from myself), but he has more or less sucessfully reversed engineered a simple prebuilt machine and added a third bit. Listening to him explain the process, and be super excited about his progress, is enough to make this geeky Dad very, very proud.</p>\n<p>I've also been kind of halfway <em>futzing</em> (that's a technical term there) around with creating a process to pull in a weeks worth of <code>raindrop.io</code> links into distinct data directories within this blog. I've got a pretty simple solution that will pull in the previous weeks worth of items, create any necessary <code>YYYY/MM</code> directory, then write a <code>response.json</code> file containing the items. I guess I'd probably rather create <em>week number</em> directories as opposed to month directories though - that would make more sense in that process. The idea being that I could have a weekly post of all the links that I wanted to save and share for that previous week. I also do use the paid <a href=\"http://raindrop.io\">raindrop.io</a> account, so I think I could maybe link to the cache - not sure on that, though. At least for me, I could.</p>\n<p>This past few days I've also been trying to get more familier with the <a href=\"https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/\">Nyxt</a> web browser. It's kind of an <em>on again, off again</em> deal with me. Some of my browsing I do over an X tunnel, and nyxt just seems a little bit faster than firefox. Plus, it's <code>lisp</code> based and I'm still in that phase of learning new things.</p>\n<p>With that, I think we shall call it an end.</p>\n<p>Wanna read my other <a href=\"/tags/weblogpomo2024\">#weblogpomo2024</a> posts?</p>\n",

Art is still allowed to be messy - and this thing is no exception. I think my favorite part of this last patch cycle was that Oracle has evidently stopped providing (what appears to be) either a second copy of their jdk, or they've streamlined it into a non-versioned directory.

The next few weeks are going to be very full of events. Along with the full schedules, comes special types of stress.</p>\n<p>Stress. Along with most people, I would imagine, I am not a fan. Some people stress eat, thankfully I am not one of those. I eat out of boredom. At least this is something that I am aware of. I've been trying to eat better for a handful of years now, some would say successfully. My wife and myself opted to go the ketogenic journey and I have kept a out 145 pounds off my frame for some time now. Three thirty plus to one eighty five, give or take.</p>\n<p>Okay, so where am I going in all of this rambling? As I get older, as I watch my kids grow into greater ages, I made a decision that I wanted to see them get older. I knew that if I had continued on in the direction that I was going, that I'd be in a grave within very little time. I have no doubt that I have avoided diabetes and at least taken one foot off of the banana peel, so to speak. Not to mention feeling much better and, hopefully, modeling a healthier behavior for my children.</p>\n<p>No rest for myself on this day, though.

I might even be able to make this interesting, but I wouldn't let odds down.</p>\n<p>This year I turn 47. Not quite the same as when one turns 40, though let's be honest here, I don't think my 40th was anything all that spectacular. Nor is it quite the same as turning 50, I'm guessing. As I get older and watch my kids get older, I can't help but think that it really wasn't all that much long ago that I was their age, almost in their shoes, going through similar phases. I've tried to do my absolute best buy my kids. My Dad, who I love, has probably told me that he loves me only a handful of times. I know he does, but I've tried to reverse that trend with my boys.</p>\n<p>I think back to some of the points in my life, I try to correlate how old my kiddo's are, to how old I was, to how old my Dad was (or, would have been at that time). I always wonder what would have been going through his mind. It's just strange, trying to put myself into his place. There are differences between the two of us, there is no doubt there. As parents, we try to ensure that our children have access to things that we never had - or, in my case things that I never knew that I should have or would have wanted. Things as simple as high school yearbooks.</p>\n<p>I didn't go to a large high school, nor did I have an over abundance of friends, nor did I ever think that I would want to ever reminisce about those years of my life. Of course, growing up I think I must have thought that yearbooks just magically showed up at school on yearbook signing day. It never would have occurred to me that there was an (at times) significant cost involved. My kids may not realize it now, but they'll be thankful for those, at least, in the future.</p>\n<p>Yes, we love our kids and want the best for them.

Today has been challenging, to say the least, so I will be putting off today's reading of the &quot;Writing to Learn&quot; book.</p>\n<p>&quot;Why is that?&quot; - I hear absolutely noone asking. Well, I'll tell you anyhow. I do much of my blog posting through <code>emacs</code> using <code>org-mode</code> capture templates. My current <code>emacs</code> configuration is a semi modified <a href=\"https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs\">doom emacs</a> build which has worked very well for me in the past and continues to do so in the present. Generally. I don't know if I had some kind of hardware issue (which is possible, as my config is hosted on a local NAS with used drives) due to perhaps a recent storm, but my org capture templates were just not working at all. Even after a <code>doom doctor</code>, <code>doom purge</code>, <code>doom build</code> cycle...nothing worked.</p>\n<p>Which necessitated a <em>nuclear option</em> of a fresh git checkout of doom and starting over. It's not really a complete do over, though, since I still have my private/personal doom init files that live in a different directory.</p>\n<p>All in all, after about an hour and ten minutes of waiting for the build process to finish (ugh...) we are back to par. Yippee.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-actual-challenge\">The actual challenge <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#the-actual-challenge\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Everything stated, I have actually read a bit of the next chapter, and all of the above was initiated because I wanted to take a handful of notes. One item in particular, about clear writing being evidence of clear thinking. Something of which I really need to strive to do - think clearly. With that, and just a little bit of focus, perhaps I can write clearly.</p>\n<p>Read my other <a href=\"/tags/weblogpomo2024\">#WeblogPoMo2024</a> posts.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>The second day brings with it a second chapter of the <a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/products/writing-to-learn-william-zinsser?variant=42347013505058\">Writing To Learn</a> book. To be completely fair, I had read about half of this yesterday and have finished it up this morning. To be even more fair, it will be highly probable that I'll read chapter 3 and add more to this post today as well. Let us find out what has been digested this go round, shall we?</p>\n<h3 id=\"gustavus-adolphus-college\">Gustavus Adolphus College <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#gustavus-adolphus-college\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Right out of the gate I learned something. While even the author, Zinsser, did believe that everybody should be able to write - he did literally write the book on the subject - the idea of <em>Writing Across the Curriculum</em> came from the small Midwestern College of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustavus_Adolphus_College\">Gustavus Adolphus</a>. Or, at least as well as I can tell according to the text. Even at that point in history (jeeze, only 1985) the professors had a need and a want to move the responsibility of teaching students to write away from the &quot;English&quot; Department. Which makes complete sense to me. We write - or should write - about more than just, well, previously written materials (books, plays, what have you). Noted within this chapter are numerous other great sources of written material - from beautiful mathematic proofs, to how the periodic table of the elements are arranged and why.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-puzzle-of-the-humanities\">A puzzle of the humanities <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#a-puzzle-of-the-humanities\">#</a></h3>\n<p>An interesting point was brought up during my reading today. If one's mind likes to work though puzzles, finding solutions to whatever has been presented to you, then perhaps no matter what the subject matter is it could be possible to find an intriguing route to write about said solution. As an example, the author has noted multiple times that they did not care for chemistry in school. Maybe if some of the work had been phrased the way that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitri_Mendeleev\">D I Mendeleev</a> had worked out the <em>Periodic Law</em> and creating a version of the <em>Period Table of the Elements</em>, then that challenge would have had a more positive effect on him. If there is some way to find a human element to whatever subject matter is being studied or written about, that seems to help a great deal.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-feeling-of-rambling\">A feeling of rambling <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#a-feeling-of-rambling\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I'm doing it again - I feel like I'm just kind of rambling on. I should tighten this stuff up. Meh.</p>\n<p>Let us finish up with a couple of quotes from the chapter that have kind of stuck with me:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Students should be learning a strong and unpretentious prose that will carry their thoughts about the world they live in.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...every subject is interesting if an avenue into it can be found that has humanity and that an ordinary person can follow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These ring well with me. I'm no journalist, no professional writer for sure. But I have read a wide variety of subjects, books, magazines, articles...those that leave the best impression are of the style that don't belittle or &quot;talk down&quot; to the reader. I find it sad that today we are losing a large amount of written work that may never be. Amazing magazines that have stopped printing. Journals that are no longer around. Yes, I am aware of the irony that any readers of this material are doing so on a media that involves a screen. It's easier, but only in so many ways.</p>\n<p>The challenge is finding it.</p>\n<p>Read my other <a href=\"/tags/weblogpomo2024\">#weblogpomo2024</a> posts.</p>\n",

As with most things that I do when it comes to writing, I haven't really planned this out. Does that mean that I'm most likely going to fail at it? That is a definite possibility. But I'm willing to at least give it a shot for myself.</p>\n<p>Of course, there is nothing like getting an <a href=\"https://echofeed.app/\">Echofeed</a> set up for it to help with some accountability - up to and including having the <a href=\"https://beep.town/@echofeedamplify\">Amplify Bot</a> boost your stuff.</p>\n<p>With that out of the way, let's get the ball rolling on <a href=\"/tags/weblogpomo2024\">#weblogpomo2024</a>!</p>\n<h3 id=\"writing-to-learn\">Writing to learn <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#writing-to-learn\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Or something like that. Writing to learn, writing to keep yourself accountable, whatever the reason it's a good skill to have. It's not necessarily something that one actually appreciates when they are younger. I graduated high school in 1995 and was fortunate enough to have had a couple of college level courses that we were able to take during our senior year - including an English course that included at least one paper. It was a great start on my college and university stint.</p>\n<p>When I did eventually enroll and find myself in college, part of our curriculum was a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_across_the_curriculum\">Writing to learn</a> selection of courses - I believe that we needed required to take two or three of these. The idea - at the time at least - was something that I can't say I was too overly fond of. I was going to be a Computer Science major and didn't feel that I needed to &quot;Write to Learn&quot;. Of course, I did though.</p>\n<p>It wouldn't be until much, <strong>much</strong> later that I would find the source of this sound reasoning: <a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/products/writing-to-learn-william-zinsser?variant=42347013505058\">William Zinsser's Book</a>. At least, I assume this to be the source. My plan, my goal, is to actually read this book. I don't think it to be too much to ask. I've already got one chapter down and I find that I really like the flow and the style. So, part of what I write about this month is going to include some of my thoughts on the book.</p>\n<p>This isn't going to be some great article series, no doubt about that. But I do hope that I'm able to improve a bit on my writing, maybe it can even become a habit to write more. I don't think I could hope to be able to write <em>better</em>, I find that I'm pretty well stuck in my ways on that account.</p>\n<p>I will end this entry with a bit of an anecdote. Not long after I moved to Lawrence, I found myself sitting at a local restaurant eating a meal. Behind me sat a couple of who I will assume to be professors from the university and they were having a conversation. The subject of students not knowing how to write papers came up, which was kind of a surprise to me. This was quite some time ago, but from what I can recall I do remember thinking to myself how sad and disturbing that was. How could students in this (that?) day and age make it through high school and into college or university and not know how to write?</p>\n<p>I can only imagine that now, it's a problem that has not gotten any better. Writing is becoming a lost art it seems.</p>\n",

Ha.</p>\n<p>Next, I finally got my copy of <em>Brain Hacks</em>, by <em>Lara Honos-Webb</em>, which seems like it could help with some organizational skills that frankly any of us could use. It was actually recommended to one of the previously mentioned twins above that he should read it for one of his projects. So he is. I don't know that he's gotten much out of it - but hopefully more than I have, as I've read an astounding two pages in it. Sigh.</p>\n<h2 id=\"i'm-better-at-reading-for-enjoyment\">I'm better at reading for enjoyment <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#i'm-better-at-reading-for-enjoyment\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I will admit, that I do actually enjoy reading and am continuing to work my way through <em>The Expanse</em> novels. Currently reading <em>Nemesis Games</em> in what spare time I can steal. I'm also reading <em>The Dark Elf Trilogy</em> to at least one of the twins, we just got into the second book the other week. This is the second go through of this series for me.</p>\n<h2 id=\"other-news%3F\">Other news? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#other-news%3F\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I always feel like I should put something down about the current state of this site. I don't know why. I'm happy with it, but not really super happy with it. I guess it's a great medium to just be able to get words down. I don't really care too much for the theme or the look of the site, but then I don't have the time to put into making it any better. I'd like to do more with webmentions and other indieweb stuff - but then I also don't do a whole lot with social media, period. It's tough.</p>\n<p>I like to write, I'll continue to write, whether or not people read really doesn't concern me.</p>\n<p>We'll leave it at that.</p>\n",

I suppose that's fine, of course, because it's good practice for any <em>actual</em> writing that might come from this site.</p>\n<p>Of course, I think that we all know there we never be any <em>actual, real</em> writing on this site. Who am I fooling, anyway?</p>\n<h2 id=\"last-time-on...\">Last Time On... <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#last-time-on...\">#</a></h2>\n<p>When last we joined in the great adventures of <em>nobody in particular</em> we had the washer and dryer in place. Not running or working, mind you. Because life is a fickle little something or other. I don't know who was in charge, or what they were smoking, or even what was running through their mind when it was decided by the powers that be that it was all &quot;A Okay&quot; to ship a meager six foot dryer power cord along with a pre-stacked washer and dryer unit.</p>\n<p>Especially when the electrical connection is at the upper back (we'll call it the upper right corner, looking at the thing from the back side) of the over six foot tall unit. Can you guess where I'm going here? Our laundry room is set up to accommodate side by side units. As I would wager most peoples' places are. Normally, this is not a problem. The power cord they ship (which, we have to purchase, naturally) didn't reach the dryer plug outlet on the wall by, oh, six inches. Not that it matters how short it was - it just flat out didn't reach.</p>\n<p>Of course nobody in town has a replacement dryer cord that we could pick up the same day. So, as we've already read, we got one from amazon. A nice, ten footer. It reached no problem. All said and done, installed, working great! Finally, clean clothes!</p>\n<h2 id=\"state-of-my-blog\">State Of My Blog <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#state-of-my-blog\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I've made some changes on the linkages up top, as well as the intro paragraph on the homearea page.

It needs some love and I'm not sure it'll ever go live, I don't know. I'd want to perchance get a shortcode template set up to make it simpler for my needs.</p>\n<p>With that, we'll call that an entry. I think I'm doing a little better, I might even expand my writing to more than waxing about this silly site that I'm making.</p>\n",

These past couple of weeks have been a grand example of that for this household.</p>\n<p>We had purchased a certain brand (<em>cough</em> Samsung <em>cough</em>) washer and dryer. Said brand evidently makes really crappy dryer drums that like to crack and break and basically vomit all over themselves. They don't admit this, of course, and they aren't taking care of the problem. So we bought another brand in a single stacked unit. Because ours is a household that is very OCD about having things be the same. Plus, the stacked unit has the controls in the middle for the short people in the home. Plus we now have a little extra storage room in the washer and dryer room.</p>\n<p>The first couple of guys who delivered the unit weren't the brightest bulbs in the garden. They either didn't know how to unhook the old units, or didn't know that &quot;Yes, Alice, there is going to be a little water that leaks out of the old hose&quot;. So they wouldn't finish the install, leaving the new unit in our garage.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to today, we get the old units removed and the new unit in place. Yes! Oh, what's this? The power cord goes from the top far corner of the unit and is about two (2) feet too stinking short?! No!! Dammit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"misery-is-a-beast\">Misery is a beast <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#misery-is-a-beast\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Yeah. So, we were super stoked to get the new unit. Now we're basically at the point where we don't even wanna see the flipping thing in the home. But there it is, mocking us. Just sitting there, all unplugged. Laughing at us. No place in town sells a 10 foot four prong dryer cord. Now, we wait for the order from our saviour...amazon. Ugh.</p>\n<p>We really were hoping to get some laundry done today.</p>\n<h2 id=\"on-the-bright-side\">On the bright side <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#on-the-bright-side\">#</a></h2>\n<p>We did get to see some of the eclipse today! So much better than 2017, when it was terribly cloudy and overcast. This one reminded me of when I was in high school (mid 90s) and we also got to experience an eclipse. Very cool.</p>\n<p>With that - until next time.</p>\n",

I'm sure that if anybody were to do any kind of digging on the interweb, they'd know where I was able to grab some of the implementation details from. Of course, we all make our own nifty little changes, and I was no different.</p>\n<p>For one, I don't like a bunch of folders and <em>index.html</em> files all over the place - so that had to go.</p>\n<p>One thing that I've noticed, here in the land of emacs, is that my capture session seems to have run into some interesting kinks. Oh, I bet it didn't like the <em>!</em> I used in the filename...what was I thinking!?</p>\n<p>Anyway.</p>\n<h2 id=\"where-was-i%3F\">Where was I? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#where-was-i%3F\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Oh yes - I wanted to kind of explain my thinking on having <em>both</em> <a href=\"/drops\">drops</a> <strong>and</strong> <a href=\"/links\">links</a>. To me, the <em>drops</em> are for pages that I want to ensure never go away. A <em>read it later</em>, if you will. The service I use (<a href=\"https://raindrop.io\">raindrop.io</a>), takes care of that for me since I'm a subscriber. <a href=\"/links\">Links</a>, on the other hand, I don't care if those stick around or not. Plus, those actually get saved as files in the repo, as opposed to the drops, which are ephemeral data from the ether.</p>\n<p>That's my thinking, anyhow.</p>\n<p>All said and done, I think for now I'm more or less finished with the structure of the site. Now, I just need more content - which will come with time. Then I can set up paging with whatever needs it. That, and get some rss feeds finalized, along with cross posting.</p>\n<p>Till next time.</p>\n",

We have (had? still have?) a Samsung Dryer.</p>\n<p>For most of you who are (not?) out there, you may or may not know that Samsung makes a really shoddy piece of junk for a dryer. The drums in them like to crack and the rollers basically destroy themselves. It's a major issue, and they are basically ignoring the problem.</p>\n<p>So we purchased a new set, that is not Samsung. The delivery was this morning, but naturally did not get to go as planned. Something to do with the water shutoff valve not cooperating with the cold water.

Really, most normal adults/kids/people/pigs/horses/spiders/lizards/whatever would probably love a good weekend day. For some reason, I'm not always a fan. I don't know why, I think it's because I miss working. Not that I'm a workaholic, but I find that I enjoy what I do in my normal life. There's just too much stuff that needs to be done during the weekend to maintain a house and home.</p>\n<p>Not that I don't like that stuff, either. It's nearly lawn mowing season - I absolutely love mowing the lawn! I don't think that 12 year old me would believe that statement, but it's true. It's a time to put the buds in and listen to some nerdcore! (note to self: I should make a section dedicated to what I'm listening to, perhaps pull in my lastfm stuff as a data collection via rss.) It's also about time to make another attempt at getting some fruit trees planted, which is always fun.</p>\n<p>Right now, I'm just sitting here, typing away, listening to the <em>Snoopy Show</em> on AppleTV. Outside, the weather is pretty nice, we've got the rather large bounce house set up outside for the youngest kiddo, it's kinda noisy too. It's funny, you know, the things that we purchase for our kids: the things that we would have killed to have when we were young. A swing set slash jungle gym. A bounce house. Various playground type equipment. Stuff that never gets used.</p>\n<p>Well, I guess that's not completely true. It does get used, some. Just not as much as one would have hoped. Meh.</p>\n<p>Sigh, well, I'm out of coffee. Of course, who needs coffee at three thirty in the afternoon? Stupid rhetorical question, that.

Even though it's running the same doom setup as my work machine, it's not perfect. My work machine, I guess I can't really say that I run emacs from that device since I ssh into a locally hosted kvm box via wsl....meh, there are differences. I wish I could grok <code>guix</code> or <code>nixos</code>, but alas, I'm stil stuck in the realm of linux.</p>\n<p>Where was I? Oh yes, I do have <code>org-capture</code> templates set up that work just fine. I need to get the popup capture buffer to take the whole frame, though. I don't like that it also visits the capture buffer in the originally opened frame as well. It's an annoyance.</p>\n<p>I'm sure there should be more. I think I'm going to wait until I've got more, eh, content, here before I get various rss feeds set up for feeding into some of my social sites. I feel that I should probably &quot;own my social&quot;, too, and I do have at least one I run - but it's certainly a chore. We shall see.</p>\n<p>With that, I'm out.</p>\n",

I'm not particularly happy with the yasnippet yet, in that I can'ts eem to get the <code>tags</code> entry items to space over and have to do that manually. Whatever. It's fine. It's all good.</p>\n<p>I think I need to add a setting into the org capture portion to make sure that the capture window takes up the whole frame, or at least isn't mirrored in another portion of my frame. It's all good, though. That must be the Pete the Cat in me talking. Ha.</p>\n<p>I also had to suppress the emacs warning from yasnippet that complained about changing the buffer - so I may have to either live with what I'll consider a hack, or come up with a better way to insert the ISO creation time stamp for the date frontmatter.</p>\n<p>I'm sure there is more.</p>\n<p>Still plenty of stuff to work on: setting up some data store files to pull in my other feeds, checking into basic webmentions (because I'm super, uber popular....ha)....among other items.</p>\n<p>This slug is acting funny.</p>\n",
