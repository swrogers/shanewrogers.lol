		  &lt;p&gt;Not much of an interesting week, this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been meaning to try to get something down and posted but it&#39;s been a week of zero motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&#39;t even mowed the lawn in two weekends at this point. Fortunately I don&#39;t think I &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to mow yet, but I probably will before the season is out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the twins was able to participate in the first cross country event this season and he did pretty well! I would like to be able to run with him, but I&#39;m not there yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still try to take my lunch hour excursions and walk. Generally I can get in just under three miles in about forty minutes. Then a quick shower before logging back in to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal still remains to run a 5K. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had ordered the &lt;em&gt;Run Your Own Mail Server&lt;/em&gt; book, by Michael W Lewis, towards the end of the pre-order period and it finally arrived this week! I&#39;ve run mail servers for myself in the past, generally through systems like &lt;a href=&quot;https://mailinabox.email/&quot;&gt;mail on a box&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://yunohost.org/&quot;&gt;yunonost&lt;/a&gt;. I think even at one point I had set up &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.qmailtoaster.net/&quot;&gt;qmail toaster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it&#39;s nice to know more about the what&#39;s and the why&#39;s, and it looks like this most excellent book is going to help out in that department. I don&#39;t know that I&#39;ll set something up from scratch... But that is certainly an itch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.some.pics/swrogers/66de154608ac5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The book: Run Your Own Mail Server, by Michael W Lucas&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;linkdump&quot;&gt;Linkdump &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#linkdump&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sigops.org/2024/the-moral-implications-of-being-a-moderately-successful-computer-scientist-and-a-woman/&quot;&gt;The Moral Implications of Being a Moderately Successful Computer Scientist and a Woman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I have not read this one yet, but it&#39;s certainly high on my list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cleoinvestigation.notion.site/Investigating-Cleo-0796ef7ce8464a90ba388cdb68e08eef&quot;&gt;Investigating Cleo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It&#39;s always entertaining to read about who mysterious anonymous posters might be, even if there is no real need or desire to dox anyone. I haven&#39;t made it through everything in this, but it&#39;s about a user in one of the math boards who always manages to post responses to some very challenging integration problems. Are they a team? Are they using multiple accounts? Who knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

I&#39;ve been looking more into learning go, so it&#39;s nice to have more stuff to learn from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s all I&#39;ve got for now, until time the next all!&lt;br&gt;

		  &lt;p&gt;Happy long weekend all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&#39;t really relax, I have this constant feeling today that I need to be doing something. Anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not like I&#39;ve been lazy today, either. Woke up, made my mug of coffee. Cleaned out the floor of our &amp;quot;soon to be coat&amp;quot; closet. Emptied the dishwasher. Filled the dishwasher. Ran the dishwasher. Took my first sip of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still there are so many things that need to be done. Or, that I feel should be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should mow the lawn, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&#39;t get motivated today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-weekend&quot;&gt;The weekend &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#the-weekend&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a pretty decent weekend I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday was a birthday party for the daughter of a friend. Our little man enjoys going over there, so it was a good time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday was the penultimate day for the local water park to be open this year, so we went out that direction. I didn&#39;t go there as I&#39;m not as big a fan, but the wife and the little did go and seemed to enjoy the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myself and the eldest twin went to the amusement park side. It was really pretty good, not too hot, not too many people. We were able to get in half a dozen rides in - mostly coasters - within a handful of hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any time you don&#39;t have to spend three hours in a single line is a good day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, we met up and had dinner in the the amusement park so the little guy could ride some stuff too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the adults got to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a successful trip, all in all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll be back in a couple of weeks for the halloween haunts they set up. Those are great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;link-dump&quot;&gt;Link dump &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#link-dump&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A day late and a dollar short. Refunds can be had at the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

Have you ever been denied a health insurance claim? This site was built by a user who was sick and tired and wanted to help others. So this was created using an LLM.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Oceans of tiredness</title>

		<content type="html">
		  &lt;p&gt;Just got back from taking the kiddos to the local water and amusement park locale...we are all incredibly tired and wore out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was, supposedly, a heat warning kinda day - but honestly it didn&#39;t seem nearly as bad as it has in the past. At the park, I didn&#39;t even get in too bad a shape until towards the end, and to be realistic I was actually cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It goes along with water and not having a large amount of body fat these days. Something of a side effect I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending some time with the kiddos in the wave pool, we headed over to the adjoining amusement park and fed the family. The nearby diner has a decent selection of, well, cheeseburgers or chicken fingers, salad, fruit, fries and onion rings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of stuff that the kids like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we have four &amp;quot;dining meals&amp;quot; to go along with the gold entry passes, it makes things more worth it to eat a couple of meals there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, good grief am I shockingly sore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;link-dump&quot;&gt;Link dump &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#link-dump&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t know how much I&#39;ll have for the weekly link dumpage, but here we go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mayank99/11ty-jsx-deno&quot;&gt;mayank99 11ty jsx and tsx template&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I&#39;m not really a huge fan of jsx style templating, but I can certainly appreciate the work that others have put in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.evalapply.org/posts/clojure-web-app-from-scratch/index.html&quot;&gt;Aditya Athalye - Clojuring the web application stack: Meditation One&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I haven&#39;t read all of this one, but I&#39;m looking forward to going through it all. I love clojure, and I like trying to write apps and web apps with it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.analog.cafe/r/a-functional-lego-camera-kit-lego-zh1-i9j8&quot;&gt;Zung Hoang - LEGO camera that works!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As an &lt;em&gt;adult fan of LEGO&lt;/em&gt;, I love this &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All right, I&#39;m gonna call that a night!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take care, till next time.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Notes of yesterday</title>
		<link href="https://shanewrogers.lol/posts/notes-of-yesterday/"/>

		<content type="html">
		  &lt;p&gt;I did not post anything yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After over a month of managing to get something put up, I skipped a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know what? That&#39;s okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not a habit until it becomes something more normal. I hope that days like yesterday are more the exception than the rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was some productivity that was had yesterday, despite the overnight rain I was able to get the lawn mowed and some other weeds taken care of. We&#39;ve got an older Snapper battery operated lawnmower, and I consider it a major accomplishment if I&#39;m able to get the lawn mowed within a single 4Ah battery. If I can get it weekly, it&#39;s usually possible, and only takes about an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I really need to run the weed eater though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second vehicle is still at the dealership, hopefully it&#39;s finished by Monday afternoon. It really stinks not having my car. Not that I go anywhere, or that I could go anywhere at this time. But still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve got a question into our insurance agent, wondering about a few things that are related about that vehicle issue, but I&#39;m not overly optimistic about any responses there. Certainly nothing favorable, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s getting close to that time to begin thinking about birthday gifts for the spouse. Sometimes I&#39;m just not really in a gift giving mood, and this seems to be one of those times. I do, however, think I know what I&#39;m going to get, so that&#39;s positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;last-week&#39;s-links&quot;&gt;Last Week&#39;s Links &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#last-week&#39;s-links&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I&#39;m going to start something new here, too, this week. In something of an effort to reduce the number of open tabs that I have on my phone, I&#39;m going to add to a listing of links that I&#39;ve found of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tiddlywiki.com/&quot;&gt;TiddlyWiki&lt;/a&gt; an older single file wiki based, server less, personal knowledge base application. I haven&#39;t used this in forever, it&#39;s good to see it&#39;s still kicking though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/how-to-install-and-configure-hubzilla/&quot;&gt;How to install and configure hubzilla&lt;/a&gt; I like the idea of Hubzilla, and I also like the idea of running my own fediverse something or other. I already have plenty of them, though, and don&#39;t need to &lt;em&gt;collect them all&lt;/em&gt; in this case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.itsfoss.com/ente-auth/&quot;&gt;Ente Auth&lt;/a&gt; I really need to get away from Google Authenticator, since it kinda stinks. You&#39;d think that Google would at least provide some kind of &lt;em&gt;search&lt;/em&gt; for theirs, but.... That&#39;s asking quite a lot. Ente seems pretty cool, they&#39;ve also got a photos replacement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cara.app/home&quot;&gt;Cara&lt;/a&gt; Something of an Instagram replacement that has had really good growth over the last few weeks from what I see. They have really strong safeguards and stances on AI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
