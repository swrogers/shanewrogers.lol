      "content_html": "<p>Last evening I had the opportunity to update one of our Oracle applications. Something that I've gone through a handful of times now and have been able to fairly well document. It's kind of a flaky system, in that it requires some toggles and buttons being pressed in a very specific order. A rather unorthodox and strange order in our opinion. But, I've got it down to a science now.</p>\n<p>Today was uneventful. So excellent.</p>\n<p>On the home news side, hopefully tomorrow we will get our second vehicle back after an accident with one of the wheels and a curb. Though it's kind of bittersweet, since it'll be a large bill. Definitely not looking forward to this.</p>\n<p>Yeah, I'm still tired and this whole vehicle situation doesn't help.</p>\n",

No real destination, no real plans. Just get in the car and drive.</p>\n<p>Realistically, I'd rather get on the bike and ride, but that's kind of challenging when one no longer has a bike to get onto. To qualify, when I refer to a bike, I'm not talking about the peddle powered version.</p>\n<p>Just me. Just on my own.</p>\n<p>I'm so tired.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<h2 id=\"another-entry-in-the-daily-stuff\">Another entry in the daily stuff <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#another-entry-in-the-daily-stuff\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Let's see what we can do about getting something written on the daily, eh? I don't know if I'll be successful here, but it's important to have some kind of goal I guess. I'll file these under the <a href=\"/tags/journal\" title=\"journal tags\">journal</a> tag (note to self: come back and make that a proper link to the journal tag page) so I can do whatever with them in the future.</p>\n<p>Today it's Saturday. Really, most normal adults/kids/people/pigs/horses/spiders/lizards/whatever would probably love a good weekend day. For some reason, I'm not always a fan. I don't know why, I think it's because I miss working. Not that I'm a workaholic, but I find that I enjoy what I do in my normal life. There's just too much stuff that needs to be done during the weekend to maintain a house and home.</p>\n<p>Not that I don't like that stuff, either. It's nearly lawn mowing season - I absolutely love mowing the lawn! I don't think that 12 year old me would believe that statement, but it's true. It's a time to put the buds in and listen to some nerdcore! (note to self: I should make a section dedicated to what I'm listening to, perhaps pull in my lastfm stuff as a data collection via rss.) It's also about time to make another attempt at getting some fruit trees planted, which is always fun.</p>\n<p>Right now, I'm just sitting here, typing away, listening to the <em>Snoopy Show</em> on AppleTV. Outside, the weather is pretty nice, we've got the rather large bounce house set up outside for the youngest kiddo, it's kinda noisy too. It's funny, you know, the things that we purchase for our kids: the things that we would have killed to have when we were young. A swing set slash jungle gym. A bounce house. Various playground type equipment. Stuff that never gets used.</p>\n<p>Well, I guess that's not completely true. It does get used, some. Just not as much as one would have hoped. Meh.</p>\n<p>Sigh, well, I'm out of coffee. Of course, who needs coffee at three thirty in the afternoon? Stupid rhetorical question, that. I always need coffee.</p>\n<h2 id=\"setup-stuff%2C-emacs-wise\">Setup stuff, emacs wise <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#setup-stuff%2C-emacs-wise\">#</a></h2>\n<p>This particular emacs setup, what I'm writing in now, from an older laptop running current Pop_OS, isn't really to my liking. Even though it's running the same doom setup as my work machine, it's not perfect. My work machine, I guess I can't really say that I run emacs from that device since I ssh into a locally hosted kvm box via wsl....meh, there are differences. I wish I could grok <code>guix</code> or <code>nixos</code>, but alas, I'm stil stuck in the realm of linux.</p>\n<p>Where was I? Oh yes, I do have <code>org-capture</code> templates set up that work just fine. I need to get the popup capture buffer to take the whole frame, though. I don't like that it also visits the capture buffer in the originally opened frame as well. It's an annoyance.</p>\n<p>I'm sure there should be more. I think I'm going to wait until I've got more, eh, content, here before I get various rss feeds set up for feeding into some of my social sites. I feel that I should probably &quot;own my social&quot;, too, and I do have at least one I run - but it's certainly a chore. We shall see.</p>\n<p>With that, I'm out.</p>\n",
