      "content_html": "<p>Let me begin today by first stating that I love our cat.</p>\n<p>I'm a cat person, more than any other animal. Please note that I stated &quot;I'm a cat person&quot; and not &quot;I'm a pet person&quot;.</p>\n<p>Over the years I've come to the conclusion that I much prefer <em>other people's pets</em> to having my own.</p>\n<p>It's just so, so much easier. And cheaper. Don't want to forget cheaper.</p>\n<p>All right, now that that's out of the way. Again, I really love our cat. He's a big ol' gray and white beast that would rather just leave you alone so much as look at you. Which is totally cool with me.</p>\n<p>I don't have to worry about him getting around my work area or laying on my laptop. I don't, generally, have to worry about him being underfoot. With the general exception of him racing me downstairs in a vain attempt to trip me.</p>\n<p>Of course life isn't all gumdrops and lollypops with the cantankerous cat around. No sir.</p>\n<p>He's an indoor cat. If it's one thing that I like even less than pets it's fleas. Most likely because fleas <em>really</em> love me. So what's the one thing in all the world that this animal desires?</p>\n<p>Yep. Uh huh. He absolutely desires to go outside. Even just the garage. And good golly gee whiz is he <strong>uber, super</strong> vocal about it.</p>\n<p>I'd swear, listening to this bad boy <strong>meowrl</strong> just could drive me insane. Dude is loud. Like, if I didn't know better we'd swear he was a she and not neutered (he is).</p>\n<p>It's a near constant ordeal, some days.</p>\n<p>Have I told you I love my cat?</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>Ah, the great and powerful Monday.</p>\n<p>I actually don't mind Mondays. Sure for some people it's the beginning of the work week (myself included), but it also means a great day of getting stuff done at work with little interruption.</p>\n<p>Naturally today we had about an hour long team meeting to discuss projects new/old/upcoming and other leadership tidbits. I don't mind, at least it wasn't a 3pm (4pm!) meeting on a Friday. Those stink.</p>\n<p>In household news, the granddaughter is starting to feel more and more comfortable. She does get a little upset and sad when her Dad leaves the room or goes to work, but it passes much quicker now than it used to. She's a whole lot happier and just seems to be in a better mood overall now. It's great to see.</p>\n<p>Today we also found out what the final cost of repairs are going to be on the vehicle. Shockingly not as bad as I was anticipating, but then I did have a worse case scenario in my head, just so I could be relieved if that was not the case. It still hurts and is money out the door and straight into the incinerator, but it could have been about a thousand dollars worse.</p>\n<p>Now all we need is for a major appliance to vomit all over itself and call it a day.</p>\n<p>I'm thinking it's about time to get some dinner prepped, so off to do that I go.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>I did not post anything yesterday.</p>\n<p>After over a month of managing to get something put up, I skipped a day.</p>\n<p>And you know what? That's okay.</p>\n<p>It's not a habit until it becomes something more normal. I hope that days like yesterday are more the exception than the rule.</p>\n<p>There was some productivity that was had yesterday, despite the overnight rain I was able to get the lawn mowed and some other weeds taken care of. We've got an older Snapper battery operated lawnmower, and I consider it a major accomplishment if I'm able to get the lawn mowed within a single 4Ah battery. If I can get it weekly, it's usually possible, and only takes about an hour.</p>\n<p>Still, I really need to run the weed eater though.</p>\n<p>The second vehicle is still at the dealership, hopefully it's finished by Monday afternoon. It really stinks not having my car. Not that I go anywhere, or that I could go anywhere at this time. But still.</p>\n<p>I've got a question into our insurance agent, wondering about a few things that are related about that vehicle issue, but I'm not overly optimistic about any responses there. Certainly nothing favorable, anyway.</p>\n<p>It's getting close to that time to begin thinking about birthday gifts for the spouse. Sometimes I'm just not really in a gift giving mood, and this seems to be one of those times. I do, however, think I know what I'm going to get, so that's positive.</p>\n<h3 id=\"last-week's-links\">Last Week's Links <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#last-week's-links\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I think I'm going to start something new here, too, this week. In something of an effort to reduce the number of open tabs that I have on my phone, I'm going to add to a listing of links that I've found of interest.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://tiddlywiki.com/\">TiddlyWiki</a> an older single file wiki based, server less, personal knowledge base application. I haven't used this in forever, it's good to see it's still kicking though.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/how-to-install-and-configure-hubzilla/\">How to install and configure hubzilla</a> I like the idea of Hubzilla, and I also like the idea of running my own fediverse something or other. I already have plenty of them, though, and don't need to <em>collect them all</em> in this case.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://news.itsfoss.com/ente-auth/\">Ente Auth</a> I really need to get away from Google Authenticator, since it kinda stinks. You'd think that Google would at least provide some kind of <em>search</em> for theirs, but.... That's asking quite a lot. Ente seems pretty cool, they've also got a photos replacement.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cara.app/home\">Cara</a> Something of an Instagram replacement that has had really good growth over the last few weeks from what I see. They have really strong safeguards and stances on AI.</li>\n</ul>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>Today we had a short conference with one of the music/band/orchestra teachers in the school district. One of the really cool things that our district provides (well, free it isn't...but it's available) is for incoming junior high students the opportunity to try out a variety of band and orchestra instruments over the course of four days, to see what they like.</p>\n<p>All of our kids have participated at this point, the current kiddo just finished his stint up. He went into it grudgingly, steadfast in his thinking that he just wanted to play the violin and nothing else. We did find out, through the whole camp experience, that he is not able to play brass - kiddo was just not able to buzz his lips. That's perfectly acceptable.</p>\n<p>Two of the instrument styles, both I suppose would be woodwinds, he actually played very well. Clarinet and flute. Totally hilarious, especially when considering that he really, <strong>really</strong>, did not want to go those days because he would just not be able to do anything at all with them. Ha.</p>\n<p>Even when all was said and done, what was his top choice? Well, still the violin. Totally cool. That said, his second choice was actually the flute. The actually also recommended that he try to choose the bass, he checked all the &quot;hell yeahs!&quot; on that one. Both the teacher that he worked with on bass, and  the assistant, were former bass players and were very excited to see how well he performed. Fortunately, those skills do translate well to the violin.</p>\n<p>All in all, we should now have half of a string quartet in our home now.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>Last evening I had the opportunity to update one of our Oracle applications. Something that I've gone through a handful of times now and have been able to fairly well document. It's kind of a flaky system, in that it requires some toggles and buttons being pressed in a very specific order. A rather unorthodox and strange order in our opinion. But, I've got it down to a science now.</p>\n<p>Today was uneventful. So excellent.</p>\n<p>On the home news side, hopefully tomorrow we will get our second vehicle back after an accident with one of the wheels and a curb. Though it's kind of bittersweet, since it'll be a large bill. Definitely not looking forward to this.</p>\n<p>Yeah, I'm still tired and this whole vehicle situation doesn't help.</p>\n",

I don't know if I'll be successful here, but it's important to have some kind of goal I guess. I'll file these under the <a href=\"/tags/journal\" title=\"journal tags\">journal</a> tag (note to self: come back and make that a proper link to the journal tag page) so I can do whatever with them in the future.</p>\n<p>Today it's Saturday. Really, most normal adults/kids/people/pigs/horses/spiders/lizards/whatever would probably love a good weekend day. For some reason, I'm not always a fan. I don't know why, I think it's because I miss working. Not that I'm a workaholic, but I find that I enjoy what I do in my normal life. There's just too much stuff that needs to be done during the weekend to maintain a house and home.</p>\n<p>Not that I don't like that stuff, either. It's nearly lawn mowing season - I absolutely love mowing the lawn! I don't think that 12 year old me would believe that statement, but it's true. It's a time to put the buds in and listen to some nerdcore! (note to self: I should make a section dedicated to what I'm listening to, perhaps pull in my lastfm stuff as a data collection via rss.) It's also about time to make another attempt at getting some fruit trees planted, which is always fun.</p>\n<p>Right now, I'm just sitting here, typing away, listening to the <em>Snoopy Show</em> on AppleTV. Outside, the weather is pretty nice, we've got the rather large bounce house set up outside for the youngest kiddo, it's kinda noisy too. It's funny, you know, the things that we purchase for our kids: the things that we would have killed to have when we were young. A swing set slash jungle gym. A bounce house. Various playground type equipment. Stuff that never gets used.</p>\n<p>Well, I guess that's not completely true. It does get used, some. Just not as much as one would have hoped. Meh.</p>\n<p>Sigh, well, I'm out of coffee. Of course, who needs coffee at three thirty in the afternoon? Stupid rhetorical question, that. I always need coffee.</p>\n<h2 id=\"setup-stuff%2C-emacs-wise\">Setup stuff, emacs wise <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#setup-stuff%2C-emacs-wise\">#</a></h2>\n<p>This particular emacs setup, what I'm writing in now, from an older laptop running current Pop_OS, isn't really to my liking. Even though it's running the same doom setup as my work machine, it's not perfect. My work machine, I guess I can't really say that I run emacs from that device since I ssh into a locally hosted kvm box via wsl....meh, there are differences. I wish I could grok <code>guix</code> or <code>nixos</code>, but alas, I'm stil stuck in the realm of linux.</p>\n<p>Where was I? Oh yes, I do have <code>org-capture</code> templates set up that work just fine. I need to get the popup capture buffer to take the whole frame, though. I don't like that it also visits the capture buffer in the originally opened frame as well. It's an annoyance.</p>\n<p>I'm sure there should be more. I think I'm going to wait until I've got more, eh, content, here before I get various rss feeds set up for feeding into some of my social sites. I feel that I should probably &quot;own my social&quot;, too, and I do have at least one I run - but it's certainly a chore. We shall see.</p>\n<p>With that, I'm out.</p>\n",
