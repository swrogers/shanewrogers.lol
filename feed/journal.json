      "content_html": "<p>I know that I have previously written on my struggle to work on maintaining my weight, as well as some of the body and confidence issues that go along with that.</p>\n<p>We shall count today's journal entry as yet another one of those.</p>\n<p>Within the next two months, August 8th I believe, will the the fifth year milestone of living a keto lifestyle.</p>\n<p>Before that, I remember sitting in my office chair and watching these amazing transformation videos of people. It always felt a little hypocritical of myself when I did this. There I sat, three hundred thirty plus pounds, knowing that I would never be able to be one of those with a success story of my own.</p>\n<p>Within weeks of starting keto, I knew that I wanted nothing more than to just be down a hundred pounds after one year.</p>\n<p>Well, I like to say that I basically turned that whole change into a game: how large of a calorie restriction could I maintain, how close to zero net carbs could I average?</p>\n<p>I blew way past that hundred pounds loss within that year and was already very close to my current weight already.</p>\n<p>My lowest weight was in the 168 pound ballpark. I'm a six foot two plus guy, and I know for a fact that that was too low. I did not look good.</p>\n<p>I have slowly worked back up to low 190s. Insofar as health goes, I know that's perfectly acceptable.</p>\n<p>But. Mentally, it is not good enough for me. I want 180s. For my mind, where I'm at is just too close to 200. I don't want to be there again.</p>\n<p>So, I know that I dropped the weight (I don't like to say I <em>lost</em> it, because I really don't want to <em>find</em> it again) really quickly. Probably not super healthily either. However, I have managed in many ways to change my relationship with food.</p>\n<p>I never really ate my feelings. It was more out of boredom than anything. Now, I really try to enjoy the feeling of looking better and use the extra time to read or work on some other self development process.</p>\n<p>If I have missed anything at all during this life change, it's that my hair is no longer thick and composed of ringlets (think Weird Al hair). That's about the only thing I miss. But, it could be age related as well.</p>\n<p>Today has been a good day, thus far, when it comes to food. Here's to keeping on.</p>\n<p>This is post 5/100 of my #100DaysToOffload posts. You can read the other posts in this series <a href=\"/tags/100daystooffload\">here</a>.</p>\n",

This would be the first year that my place of employment has (I think...) provided those of us who are able to have the Holiday off, off.

So, yeah, when you've worked there and seen that the department has had to replace two engines because reasons - you lose what little faith there was.</p>\n<p>Where was I? Oh, yes, the vehicle was taken into this store to get the battery checked and maybe replaced. Evidently, they checked the battery and it was fine. I guess.</p>\n<p>I don't know, though.

No sir.</p>\n<p>He's an indoor cat. If it's one thing that I like even less than pets it's fleas. Most likely because fleas <em>really</em> love me. So what's the one thing in all the world that this animal desires?</p>\n<p>Yep. Uh huh. He absolutely desires to go outside. Even just the garage. And good golly gee whiz is he <strong>uber, super</strong> vocal about it.</p>\n<p>I'd swear, listening to this bad boy <strong>meowrl</strong> just could drive me insane. Dude is loud.

I don't mind, at least it wasn't a 3pm (4pm!) meeting on a Friday. Those stink.</p>\n<p>In household news, the granddaughter is starting to feel more and more comfortable.

Shockingly not as bad as I was anticipating, but then I did have a worse case scenario in my head, just so I could be relieved if that was not the case.

It really stinks not having my car. Not that I go anywhere, or that I could go anywhere at this time. But still.</p>\n<p>I've got a question into our insurance agent, wondering about a few things that are related about that vehicle issue, but I'm not overly optimistic about any responses there. Certainly nothing favorable, anyway.</p>\n<p>It's getting close to that time to begin thinking about birthday gifts for the spouse.

One of the really cool things that our district provides (well, free it isn't...but it's available) is for incoming junior high students the opportunity to try out a variety of band and orchestra instruments over the course of four days, to see what they like.</p>\n<p>All of our kids have participated at this point, the current kiddo just finished his stint up. He went into it grudgingly, steadfast in his thinking that he just wanted to play the violin and nothing else. We did find out, through the whole camp experience, that he is not able to play brass - kiddo was just not able to buzz his lips. That's perfectly acceptable.</p>\n<p>Two of the instrument styles, both I suppose would be woodwinds, he actually played very well. Clarinet and flute. Totally hilarious, especially when considering that he really, <strong>really</strong>, did not want to go those days because he would just not be able to do anything at all with them. Ha.</p>\n<p>Even when all was said and done, what was his top choice? Well, still the violin. Totally cool. That said, his second choice was actually the flute. The actually also recommended that he try to choose the bass, he checked all the &quot;hell yeahs!&quot; on that one. Both the teacher that he worked with on bass, and  the assistant, were former bass players and were very excited to see how well he performed. Fortunately, those skills do translate well to the violin.</p>\n<p>All in all, we should now have half of a string quartet in our home now.</p>\n",

I don't know if I'll be successful here, but it's important to have some kind of goal I guess. I'll file these under the <a href=\"/tags/journal\" title=\"journal tags\">journal</a> tag (note to self: come back and make that a proper link to the journal tag page) so I can do whatever with them in the future.</p>\n<p>Today it's Saturday. Really, most normal adults/kids/people/pigs/horses/spiders/lizards/whatever would probably love a good weekend day. For some reason, I'm not always a fan. I don't know why, I think it's because I miss working. Not that I'm a workaholic, but I find that I enjoy what I do in my normal life. There's just too much stuff that needs to be done during the weekend to maintain a house and home.</p>\n<p>Not that I don't like that stuff, either. It's nearly lawn mowing season - I absolutely love mowing the lawn! I don't think that 12 year old me would believe that statement, but it's true. It's a time to put the buds in and listen to some nerdcore! (note to self: I should make a section dedicated to what I'm listening to, perhaps pull in my lastfm stuff as a data collection via rss.) It's also about time to make another attempt at getting some fruit trees planted, which is always fun.</p>\n<p>Right now, I'm just sitting here, typing away, listening to the <em>Snoopy Show</em> on AppleTV. Outside, the weather is pretty nice, we've got the rather large bounce house set up outside for the youngest kiddo, it's kinda noisy too. It's funny, you know, the things that we purchase for our kids: the things that we would have killed to have when we were young. A swing set slash jungle gym. A bounce house. Various playground type equipment. Stuff that never gets used.</p>\n<p>Well, I guess that's not completely true. It does get used, some. Just not as much as one would have hoped. Meh.</p>\n<p>Sigh, well, I'm out of coffee. Of course, who needs coffee at three thirty in the afternoon? Stupid rhetorical question, that. I always need coffee.</p>\n<h2 id=\"setup-stuff%2C-emacs-wise\">Setup stuff, emacs wise <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#setup-stuff%2C-emacs-wise\">#</a></h2>\n<p>This particular emacs setup, what I'm writing in now, from an older laptop running current Pop_OS, isn't really to my liking. Even though it's running the same doom setup as my work machine, it's not perfect. My work machine, I guess I can't really say that I run emacs from that device since I ssh into a locally hosted kvm box via wsl....meh, there are differences. I wish I could grok <code>guix</code> or <code>nixos</code>, but alas, I'm stil stuck in the realm of linux.</p>\n<p>Where was I? Oh yes, I do have <code>org-capture</code> templates set up that work just fine. I need to get the popup capture buffer to take the whole frame, though. I don't like that it also visits the capture buffer in the originally opened frame as well. It's an annoyance.</p>\n<p>I'm sure there should be more. I think I'm going to wait until I've got more, eh, content, here before I get various rss feeds set up for feeding into some of my social sites. I feel that I should probably &quot;own my social&quot;, too, and I do have at least one I run - but it's certainly a chore. We shall see.</p>\n<p>With that, I'm out.</p>\n",
