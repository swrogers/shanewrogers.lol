      "content_html": "<p>Today was the recognition ceremony for our fifth grader. This is certainly a special class, one that we feel honored to have gotten to be involved with. Our fellow parents are amazing, our son's peer group is just flat out phenomenal, we couldn't ask for anything better.</p>\n<p>This class has marked a couple of milestones. First, the school principal started out with this group in kindergarten. She's been a wonderful person - an advocate above all who believes in all the students. Sadly for this school, she is leaving for another district.</p>\n<p>Second, our young man has had a gifted IEP for a number of years now (recall what I said about the principal being an advocate?), and he was the first gifted student for his particular gifted facilitator. She, too, has been a joy to work with. We have had nothing but positive memories for this school and the people there.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, we still have one more kiddo to take through this journey. He is getting to go through this school's beginning of a Montessori program. So far, it's been good for him. We would have loved to have had more of them go through this type of learning system, but at least one is able to.</p>\n<p>When we first moved here, I admit to having doubts about this area and this school - but no longer.</p>\n<p>Wanna read my other <a href=\"/tags/weblogpomo2024\">#weblogpomo2024</a> posts?</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>The 20th of the month, and the first time that I've actually sat down at a computer to write a post in, oh, what seems like forever at this point. I've remembered to <code>git pull --rebase</code> so - hopefully - there won't be any errors thrown by git. What I've not done is to come up with some kind of theme for todays entry.</p>\n<p>The morning was pretty much blown, not only was there no real sleep to have been had (stopped up nasal situation, creating a wonderfully sore throat), but then there was the need to get the two oldest and the youngest kiddos in for their annual &quot;well child&quot; check. Always a good time. At least our family doctor is easy to talk to and we generally really like her. Would definitely recommend her as a local doc anytime I see people ask about who to go to in any of the local groups. The only thing that I (we...) don't care so much for is the fact that her practice was sucked up into the local hospital conglomerate a handful of years ago. Ugh.</p>\n<h3 id=\"just-chillaxing-here\">Just chillaxing here <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#just-chillaxing-here\">#</a></h3>\n<p>So, I'm just sitting here putting off one of the more dull parts of my duties. Instead of which, I'm listening to my eldest twin talk his way through an attempted understanding of building a binary input system that outputs an analog number using simple logic gates. Not only has he basically taught this to himself (with a small amount of input from myself), but he has more or less sucessfully reversed engineered a simple prebuilt machine and added a third bit. Listening to him explain the process, and be super excited about his progress, is enough to make this geeky Dad very, very proud.</p>\n<p>I've also been kind of halfway <em>futzing</em> (that's a technical term there) around with creating a process to pull in a weeks worth of <code>raindrop.io</code> links into distinct data directories within this blog. I've got a pretty simple solution that will pull in the previous weeks worth of items, create any necessary <code>YYYY/MM</code> directory, then write a <code>response.json</code> file containing the items. I guess I'd probably rather create <em>week number</em> directories as opposed to month directories though - that would make more sense in that process. The idea being that I could have a weekly post of all the links that I wanted to save and share for that previous week. I also do use the paid <a href=\"http://raindrop.io\">raindrop.io</a> account, so I think I could maybe link to the cache - not sure on that, though. At least for me, I could.</p>\n<p>This past few days I've also been trying to get more familier with the <a href=\"https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/\">Nyxt</a> web browser. It's kind of an <em>on again, off again</em> deal with me. Some of my browsing I do over an X tunnel, and nyxt just seems a little bit faster than firefox. Plus, it's <code>lisp</code> based and I'm still in that phase of learning new things.</p>\n<p>With that, I think we shall call it an end.</p>\n<p>Wanna read my other <a href=\"/tags/weblogpomo2024\">#weblogpomo2024</a> posts?</p>\n",

One of these days I'll figure out what it is about the weekend or time off that I don't care for. Sigh.</p>\n<p>Managed to get the dishwasher unloaded and reloaded this morning. Sometimes I still feel very much like that butter robot. Only I get to do more than just &quot;pass the butter&quot;, I also get to fetch fresh paper towel rolls from storage! Aren't I lucky.</p>\n<p>I know that people don't take me for granted, but good grief sometimes it really does feel that way. Are there things in my life that I would haved changed, given the chance? Sure, I don't think that there is anybody out there that would say otherwise. I try to stay upbeat and somewhat optimistic, but it can be a challenge. Especially when you live with somebody who has depression. Anyhow.</p>\n<p>I was going to write something here related to what I've stated above, but I'm not too sure that I want to get into some of these items just at this time. At least not in public. While I don't share these posts within my <em>close friend group</em>, neither is this site exactly hidden. I think I'll just leave it at that for a bit. Talk about vague posting, I guess.</p>\n<p>Now for an attempt at something a little less depressing I guess. While I really, really have been enjoying Zettel Notes, I would like a way to more easily share pics on this site. Without the need to host the images myself. Yeah, that kinda limits me with workflow simplicity. I've got the pixelfed account, so there is that, but then omg.lol also has a pretty simple image host as well. Both just take a little extra steps. But this should work, I guess.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.some.pics/swrogers/664a23faee93d.jpg\" alt=\"Cropped picture of my IronFlask coffee mug.\"></p>\n<p>I guess that should do for today.</p>\n<p>Wanna read my other <a href=\"/tags/weblogpomo2024\">#weblogpomo2024</a> posts?</p>\n",

Still feels like sleeping half the morning away, though, especially when one is used to getting up at 6am.</p>\n<p>For a Saturday it's been kinda productive, managed to get the lawn mowed for the first time in over a week. It's funny, when I was a kid and had to mow two yards and a large back lot I was never a fan of the chore. It could have had something to do with needing to deal with a black walnut tree....if you know, you know. Ugh. Now, though, it's a good time to unwind with some music and enjoy the process.</p>\n<p>Certainly it's not something that I'd consider a chore. My yard doesn't look the best in the neighborhood, but at least it's far from the worst. I try to take at least a little bit of pride in how the home looks. It doesn't hurt that the neighbors also have really nice lawns.</p>\n<p>I've got other things around the home that I'd like to do - one of which being permanent holiday lighting with some programmable LEDs.

I can't complain about how the day has gone, it's been pretty good and relatively productive. I'm just glad that the little one was able to go and stay at school all day! I love that my kids, generally, enjoy school.</p>\n<p>Part of my job role involves application upgrades for some decently large vendors, Oracle and Salesforce come to mind. These upgrades can be a tad kludgy. An understatement to say the least. I've been through a handful of one upgrade in particular that I have been able to get documented fairly well, and I believe that I now have it down to, if not a science then at least an art. Art is still allowed to be messy - and this thing is no exception. I think my favorite part of this last patch cycle was that Oracle has evidently stopped providing (what appears to be) either a second copy of their jdk, or they've streamlined it into a non-versioned directory. Which I suppose is nice. At least it was easy enough to sort out.</p>\n<p>We've got some other projects in the hopper at work, and it feels good to be a part of them. It almost feels like progress.</p>\n<p>Ah, the kids are picked up. Some garlic olives have been snacked on (it is weird how ones tastes change when away from carbohydrates for so long).

At least the cough is more or less done.</p>\n<p>As is the way of things, after taking a week off of work today has basically been spent playing catch-up. At least it hasn't been as bad as it's been in the past. Just a couple of quick answers that needed to be sent out. I'm so glad this is a slower time of year. I've generally taken two weeks off at a time, but figured I'd change things up this go round.

No. I should write for myself, no matter how mundane I think the entry of the day will be.

I had myself stationed at what I'll refer to as the <em>sponge fighting</em> location. One of the handful of water areas that are set up. The idea here being that the kids pair up and toss a sopping wet sponge back and forth. If you can't catch the sponge, then you wring it out over your head. It's all good fun. It all more or less kind of devolves into &quot;let's just throw wet sponges at each other!&quot;</p>\n<p>We go back shortly to help out with the Montessori primary group - the kindergartners.

One wouldn't think that 10 minutes would make much of a difference, but it certainly can. We did get there in time, so yay. Of course, for me just being some place <em>on time</em> actually means that <em>I'm late</em>. Now, if I could only get my spouse to adhere to that philosophy. 😂</p>\n<p>This morning, and tomorrow morning, will both be basically the same. The twins have a music performance on Friday that is the big finale for the year. Tonight we also have a band concert for one of them. Like I said the other day, it's gonna be a full week. It <em>has been</em> a full week.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mobile-editing\">Mobile editing <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#mobile-editing\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I think I may have finally found a decent markdown editor that can sync with my git blog repo: <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.eu.thedoc.zettelnotes\">Zettel Notes</a>. Well, sure, there have been others that can sync and work, but I think I really prefer this one for some reason. Probably because it can actually move files around when requested as opposed to copying them.</p>\n<p>I think the only thing that I would like to be able to do from mobile (apart from easier photo uploads, but someday maybe) would be running the eleventy test server. Other than that, I'm pretty content with what's available now.</p>\n<p>Wanna read my other <a href=\"/tags/weblogpomo2024\">#weblogpomo2024</a> posts?</p>\n",

The next few weeks are going to be very full of events. Along with the full schedules, comes special types of stress.</p>\n<p>Stress. Along with most people, I would imagine, I am not a fan. Some people stress eat, thankfully I am not one of those. I eat out of boredom. At least this is something that I am aware of. I've been trying to eat better for a handful of years now, some would say successfully. My wife and myself opted to go the ketogenic journey and I have kept a out 145 pounds off my frame for some time now. Three thirty plus to one eighty five, give or take.</p>\n<p>Okay, so where am I going in all of this rambling? As I get older, as I watch my kids grow into greater ages, I made a decision that I wanted to see them get older. I knew that if I had continued on in the direction that I was going, that I'd be in a grave within very little time. I have no doubt that I have avoided diabetes and at least taken one foot off of the banana peel, so to speak. Not to mention feeling much better and, hopefully, modeling a healthier behavior for my children.</p>\n<p>No rest for myself on this day, though. The second day of my vacation and I've done little to nothing that I would like to get done. Ah, but then who really wants to do pre-spring cleaning on their vacations.</p>\n<p>Read the rest of my <a href=\"/tags/weblogpomo2024\">#weblogpomo2024</a> posts.</p>\n",

I've not made nearly the progress on my book that I'd like to, so today's entry will be another one of those &quot;day in the life of&quot; ordeals. I might even be able to make this interesting, but I wouldn't let odds down.</p>\n<p>This year I turn 47. Not quite the same as when one turns 40, though let's be honest here, I don't think my 40th was anything all that spectacular. Nor is it quite the same as turning 50, I'm guessing. As I get older and watch my kids get older, I can't help but think that it really wasn't all that much long ago that I was their age, almost in their shoes, going through similar phases. I've tried to do my absolute best buy my kids. My Dad, who I love, has probably told me that he loves me only a handful of times. I know he does, but I've tried to reverse that trend with my boys.</p>\n<p>I think back to some of the points in my life, I try to correlate how old my kiddo's are, to how old I was, to how old my Dad was (or, would have been at that time). I always wonder what would have been going through his mind. It's just strange, trying to put myself into his place. There are differences between the two of us, there is no doubt there. As parents, we try to ensure that our children have access to things that we never had - or, in my case things that I never knew that I should have or would have wanted. Things as simple as high school yearbooks.</p>\n<p>I didn't go to a large high school, nor did I have an over abundance of friends, nor did I ever think that I would want to ever reminisce about those years of my life. Of course, growing up I think I must have thought that yearbooks just magically showed up at school on yearbook signing day. It never would have occurred to me that there was an (at times) significant cost involved. My kids may not realize it now, but they'll be thankful for those, at least, in the future.</p>\n<p>Yes, we love our kids and want the best for them. Though, what parent does not.</p>\n<p>Anyway, with that I think we shall close out this day.</p>\n<p>Read the rest of my <a href=\"/tags/weblogpomo2024\">#weblogpomo2024</a> posts.</p>\n",

It failed to save the new file in the appropriate folder, though I'm fairly certain I saved it where it needed. Then when trying to move it, it does a copy instead.</p>\n<p>Which plays havoc with the push to git and the workflow run. Sigh.</p>\n<p>So, in my attempt to both come up with a post today <em>and</em> perhaps a decent mobile way to post, today is just straight into the github web site and add a new post. Is it preferable? Absolutely not.</p>\n<p>In other news today, I was able to get the yard mowed before it rained.

Today has been challenging, to say the least, so I will be putting off today's reading of the &quot;Writing to Learn&quot; book.</p>\n<p>&quot;Why is that?&quot; - I hear absolutely noone asking. Well, I'll tell you anyhow. I do much of my blog posting through <code>emacs</code> using <code>org-mode</code> capture templates. My current <code>emacs</code> configuration is a semi modified <a href=\"https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs\">doom emacs</a> build which has worked very well for me in the past and continues to do so in the present. Generally. I don't know if I had some kind of hardware issue (which is possible, as my config is hosted on a local NAS with used drives) due to perhaps a recent storm, but my org capture templates were just not working at all. Even after a <code>doom doctor</code>, <code>doom purge</code>, <code>doom build</code> cycle...nothing worked.</p>\n<p>Which necessitated a <em>nuclear option</em> of a fresh git checkout of doom and starting over. It's not really a complete do over, though, since I still have my private/personal doom init files that live in a different directory.</p>\n<p>All in all, after about an hour and ten minutes of waiting for the build process to finish (ugh...) we are back to par. Yippee.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-actual-challenge\">The actual challenge <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#the-actual-challenge\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Everything stated, I have actually read a bit of the next chapter, and all of the above was initiated because I wanted to take a handful of notes. One item in particular, about clear writing being evidence of clear thinking. Something of which I really need to strive to do - think clearly. With that, and just a little bit of focus, perhaps I can write clearly.</p>\n<p>Read my other <a href=\"/tags/weblogpomo2024\">#WeblogPoMo2024</a> posts.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>The second day brings with it a second chapter of the <a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/products/writing-to-learn-william-zinsser?variant=42347013505058\">Writing To Learn</a> book. To be completely fair, I had read about half of this yesterday and have finished it up this morning. To be even more fair, it will be highly probable that I'll read chapter 3 and add more to this post today as well. Let us find out what has been digested this go round, shall we?</p>\n<h3 id=\"gustavus-adolphus-college\">Gustavus Adolphus College <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#gustavus-adolphus-college\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Right out of the gate I learned something. While even the author, Zinsser, did believe that everybody should be able to write - he did literally write the book on the subject - the idea of <em>Writing Across the Curriculum</em> came from the small Midwestern College of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustavus_Adolphus_College\">Gustavus Adolphus</a>. Or, at least as well as I can tell according to the text. Even at that point in history (jeeze, only 1985) the professors had a need and a want to move the responsibility of teaching students to write away from the &quot;English&quot; Department. Which makes complete sense to me. We write - or should write - about more than just, well, previously written materials (books, plays, what have you). Noted within this chapter are numerous other great sources of written material - from beautiful mathematic proofs, to how the periodic table of the elements are arranged and why.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-puzzle-of-the-humanities\">A puzzle of the humanities <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#a-puzzle-of-the-humanities\">#</a></h3>\n<p>An interesting point was brought up during my reading today. If one's mind likes to work though puzzles, finding solutions to whatever has been presented to you, then perhaps no matter what the subject matter is it could be possible to find an intriguing route to write about said solution. As an example, the author has noted multiple times that they did not care for chemistry in school. Maybe if some of the work had been phrased the way that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitri_Mendeleev\">D I Mendeleev</a> had worked out the <em>Periodic Law</em> and creating a version of the <em>Period Table of the Elements</em>, then that challenge would have had a more positive effect on him. If there is some way to find a human element to whatever subject matter is being studied or written about, that seems to help a great deal.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-feeling-of-rambling\">A feeling of rambling <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#a-feeling-of-rambling\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I'm doing it again - I feel like I'm just kind of rambling on. I should tighten this stuff up. Meh.</p>\n<p>Let us finish up with a couple of quotes from the chapter that have kind of stuck with me:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Students should be learning a strong and unpretentious prose that will carry their thoughts about the world they live in.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...every subject is interesting if an avenue into it can be found that has humanity and that an ordinary person can follow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These ring well with me. I'm no journalist, no professional writer for sure. But I have read a wide variety of subjects, books, magazines, articles...those that leave the best impression are of the style that don't belittle or &quot;talk down&quot; to the reader. I find it sad that today we are losing a large amount of written work that may never be. Amazing magazines that have stopped printing. Journals that are no longer around. Yes, I am aware of the irony that any readers of this material are doing so on a media that involves a screen. It's easier, but only in so many ways.</p>\n<p>The challenge is finding it.</p>\n<p>Read my other <a href=\"/tags/weblogpomo2024\">#weblogpomo2024</a> posts.</p>\n",

As with most things that I do when it comes to writing, I haven't really planned this out. Does that mean that I'm most likely going to fail at it? That is a definite possibility. But I'm willing to at least give it a shot for myself.</p>\n<p>Of course, there is nothing like getting an <a href=\"https://echofeed.app/\">Echofeed</a> set up for it to help with some accountability - up to and including having the <a href=\"https://beep.town/@echofeedamplify\">Amplify Bot</a> boost your stuff.</p>\n<p>With that out of the way, let's get the ball rolling on <a href=\"/tags/weblogpomo2024\">#weblogpomo2024</a>!</p>\n<h3 id=\"writing-to-learn\">Writing to learn <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#writing-to-learn\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Or something like that. Writing to learn, writing to keep yourself accountable, whatever the reason it's a good skill to have. It's not necessarily something that one actually appreciates when they are younger. I graduated high school in 1995 and was fortunate enough to have had a couple of college level courses that we were able to take during our senior year - including an English course that included at least one paper. It was a great start on my college and university stint.</p>\n<p>When I did eventually enroll and find myself in college, part of our curriculum was a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_across_the_curriculum\">Writing to learn</a> selection of courses - I believe that we needed required to take two or three of these. The idea - at the time at least - was something that I can't say I was too overly fond of. I was going to be a Computer Science major and didn't feel that I needed to &quot;Write to Learn&quot;. Of course, I did though.</p>\n<p>It wouldn't be until much, <strong>much</strong> later that I would find the source of this sound reasoning: <a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/products/writing-to-learn-william-zinsser?variant=42347013505058\">William Zinsser's Book</a>. At least, I assume this to be the source. My plan, my goal, is to actually read this book. I don't think it to be too much to ask. I've already got one chapter down and I find that I really like the flow and the style. So, part of what I write about this month is going to include some of my thoughts on the book.</p>\n<p>This isn't going to be some great article series, no doubt about that. But I do hope that I'm able to improve a bit on my writing, maybe it can even become a habit to write more. I don't think I could hope to be able to write <em>better</em>, I find that I'm pretty well stuck in my ways on that account.</p>\n<p>I will end this entry with a bit of an anecdote. Not long after I moved to Lawrence, I found myself sitting at a local restaurant eating a meal. Behind me sat a couple of who I will assume to be professors from the university and they were having a conversation. The subject of students not knowing how to write papers came up, which was kind of a surprise to me. This was quite some time ago, but from what I can recall I do remember thinking to myself how sad and disturbing that was. How could students in this (that?) day and age make it through high school and into college or university and not know how to write?</p>\n<p>I can only imagine that now, it's a problem that has not gotten any better. Writing is becoming a lost art it seems.</p>\n",
