Anything.</p>\n<p>It's not like I've been lazy today, either. Woke up, made my mug of coffee. Cleaned out the floor of our &quot;soon to be coat&quot; closet. Emptied the dishwasher. Filled the dishwasher. Ran the dishwasher. Took my first sip of coffee.</p>\n<p>Still there are so many things that need to be done. Or, that I feel should be done.</p>\n<p>I should mow the lawn, for example.</p>\n<p>I can't get motivated today.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-weekend\">The weekend <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#the-weekend\">#</a></h3>\n<p>We had a pretty decent weekend I guess.</p>\n<p>Saturday was a birthday party for the daughter of a friend. Our little man enjoys going over there, so it was a good time.</p>\n<p>Sunday was the penultimate day for the local water park to be open this year, so we went out that direction. I didn't go there as I'm not as big a fan, but the wife and the little did go and seemed to enjoy the day.</p>\n<p>Myself and the eldest twin went to the amusement park side. It was really pretty good, not too hot, not too many people. We were able to get in half a dozen rides in - mostly coasters - within a handful of hours.</p>\n<p>Any time you don't have to spend three hours in a single line is a good day.</p>\n<p>Afterwards, we met up and had dinner in the the amusement park so the little guy could ride some stuff too.</p>\n<p>Then the adults got to eat.</p>\n<p>It was a successful trip, all in all.</p>\n<p>We'll be back in a couple of weeks for the halloween haunts they set up.

Great! But damn...it sure seems like we <em>just</em> went through all this!</p>\n<p>I guess that was in mid to late May. But <em>test</em> didn't get patched until flipping June, not to mention <em>prod</em> not that long ago.</p>\n<p>Ugh. At least they actually keep stuff updated. No new patches available for the gateway product, yet, so we'll keep an eye out there.</p>\n<p>It's been a pretty good week, actually. Got some documentation written and sent out. Got a quote and an order out together for some new laptops to replace out of warranty stuff. Not a bad week.</p>\n<h3 id=\"no-flame-wars-here\">No flame wars here <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#no-flame-wars-here\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I figured I'd start a separate header for this one.</p>\n<p>I have always been of the belief that you should use the tool, or tools, that work for you and your situation. If that took us, say, <em>vi</em>, then great! If that took is <em>emacs</em>, then great! Personally, it effects me exactly zero on the iota scale.</p>\n<p>Whatever makes you happy and floats that boat, or scratches that itch, or whatever. Though, I do believe that every body who is going to do any kind of system administration on a Unix style server should at least be able to stumble through vi or vim. If for no other reason than it's almost always available.</p>\n<p>Then even within those two sacred camps you've got people who espouse certain styles of usage. Take emacs, for example. Some people like to use the &quot;starter kits&quot;. Be that purcell, spacemacs, doom, bedrock, etc etc. Some people think you should use vanilla. Some people swear by a literate programming version of their config.</p>\n<p>Those are all awesome! Again, use what works for you. Personally, I'm familiar with vi enough that I'm a little dangerous. I don't have any kind of vi setup, I just know enough to get by. I have used emacs for some time now, my first real usage and &quot;config&quot; was spacemacs. Then I've gone through other kits. I've tried rolling my own, with and without a literate config. I've finally stopped with doom, complete with my own customizations.</p>\n<p>Just use what works. In Whatever way that is.</p>\n<p>That's all I've got on that.</p>\n<p>This is post 34/100 of my #100DaysToOffload posts.

Whatever that something might be.</p>\n<p>Whether it's putting myself out there when looking for employment, for example, I have that fear not of <em>what if I get denied</em> but of <em>what if I get approved?</em></p>\n<p>Then there are social situations. This might, or might not, have just as much to do with being introverted as well, though.</p>\n<p>Let us say that I were to go looking for some kind of connection. Platonic or otherwise, it makes no matter. Frankly, I'm terrible at small talk. I've been told that I'm a competent communicator, but that's not necessarily for me to decide.</p>\n<p>I don't know how to make friends any more.

Baseball. Basketball. Football.</p>\n<p>I could actually pitch with either left or right handed. Couldn't do it now to save my life, but it was a thing I was capable of.</p>\n<p>I never liked any of it though.</p>\n<p>Probably didn't help that all of the teams I was on stunk. But that's not relevant.</p>\n<p>I was able to come to the conclusion the other day that the only person I compete with, in any way, is myself.</p>\n<p>And it does not allow me to relax. Ever.</p>\n<p>Take keto, for example. When we started on keto five years ago I dove into the deep end. Got an app and basically <em>gamed the heck out of it</em>. I would try to see just how few carbs I could do compared to all the other users of the app. Routinely I fell into the top tier and could easily go less than 5 to 7 net carbs a day. Logging everything.</p>\n<p>I would go to sleep at night super stoked to get up in morning to see how much weight has fallen off. Quite often it would be a pound or so.</p>\n<p>Was it safe? Not really. But it was my addiction, that self competition.</p>\n<p>Another example would be when I take my noon walks.</p>\n<p>I would imagine that when most people take walks it helps to clear their minds for the time ahead.</p>\n<p>Yeah, that's not how my head works.</p>\n<p>My oh my how I wish it did.</p>\n<p>Nope, I have this constant beat that runs through my mind: <em>one, two, three, four, one, two...</em> On and on and on.</p>\n<p>I have the need to push myself, quicker and quicker. Finish strong! I tell myself.</p>\n<p>I matters not if I've got music in my ears or listening to an NPR podcast.

Not that they don't always have, or that they won't always have two grades between them. Sometimes we forget that the youngest of these three is the <em>youngest</em> of the three - this kiddo has seemed for some time now to be the more mature of them all. Always a surprise to me and also I must admit that I am not overly certain that I am deserving of such amazing children.</p>\n<p>One of the twins will be spending the first part of some days at another school taking higher level math courses. Similar to what the youngest kiddo was going through last year, when he bussed from the elementary school to the middle school for his math course. I am more scared for the elder twin, though, than I was for the younger brother. Probably has to do with the fact he'll be going into a High School, opposed to a middle school.</p>\n<p>I think that everybody will do fine, but as a parent I think I'm allowed to feel that fear for my kiddo.</p>\n<p>We also find ourselves near the time of open enrollment for insurance.</p>\n<p>This year, I'm definitely looking forward to making some changes there. My wife has recently - this is her third week - started working at the same employer as I. Which means that we'll get to save a not insignificant amount of money on insurance! She will take over her own insurance plan and payment, using the same provider. I will continue to cover the kids and myself. All in, we look to save about $500 a month for coverage.</p>\n<p>It is insane.</p>\n<p>I have slowly been working my way through <a href=\"https://thebookofelsewhere.com/\">the book of elsewhere</a>, taking a bit of a break from The Expanse books.

It always felt a little hypocritical of myself when I did this. There I sat, three hundred thirty plus pounds, knowing that I would never be able to be one of those with a success story of my own.</p>\n<p>Within weeks of starting keto, I knew that I wanted nothing more than to just be down a hundred pounds after one year.</p>\n<p>Well, I like to say that I basically turned that whole change into a game: how large of a calorie restriction could I maintain, how close to zero net carbs could I average?</p>\n<p>I blew way past that hundred pounds loss within that year and was already very close to my current weight already.</p>\n<p>My lowest weight was in the 168 pound ballpark.
