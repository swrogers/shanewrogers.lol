Lots of trees down. Lots of power lines down. We were without power for just under 24 hours here, though some unfortunately people were much longer.</p>\n<p>If it's something that we take for granted, it's electricity. Thankfully our home is decently insulated, so the downstairs remained in the lower mid 70s temperature wise. The upstairs, not so much.</p>\n<p>We were gonna have the kids sleep downstairs the second night, but that was not necessary. The thought had occurred to get a couple of hotel rooms, but we didn't really want to spend the near $300 that would have ran us.</p>\n<p>It was certainly very nice when power was restored.</p>\n<h3 id=\"linkdump\">Linkdump <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#linkdump\">#</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12352\">Getting Disappeared</a><br>\nSome preaching to the choir about getting off of Google (et al) services.

      "content_html": "<p>The new school season is nearly upon us once again.</p>\n<p>We will have three kiddos back in the same building, at least for a little while, with but two grades between them. Not that they don't always have, or that they won't always have two grades between them. Sometimes we forget that the youngest of these three is the <em>youngest</em> of the three - this kiddo has seemed for some time now to be the more mature of them all. Always a surprise to me and also I must admit that I am not overly certain that I am deserving of such amazing children.</p>\n<p>One of the twins will be spending the first part of some days at another school taking higher level math courses. Similar to what the youngest kiddo was going through last year, when he bussed from the elementary school to the middle school for his math course. I am more scared for the elder twin, though, than I was for the younger brother. Probably has to do with the fact he'll be going into a High School, opposed to a middle school.</p>\n<p>I think that everybody will do fine, but as a parent I think I'm allowed to feel that fear for my kiddo.</p>\n<p>We also find ourselves near the time of open enrollment for insurance.</p>\n<p>This year, I'm definitely looking forward to making some changes there. My wife has recently - this is her third week - started working at the same employer as I. Which means that we'll get to save a not insignificant amount of money on insurance! She will take over her own insurance plan and payment, using the same provider. I will continue to cover the kids and myself. All in, we look to save about $500 a month for coverage.</p>\n<p>It is insane.</p>\n<p>I have slowly been working my way through <a href=\"https://thebookofelsewhere.com/\">the book of elsewhere</a>, taking a bit of a break from The Expanse books. The hope is that I can finish reading this before my hardback copy of the BRZRKR graphic novel arrives, which should arrive early October I think.

It was a pretty decent tale, with a handful of threads that wove together okay. I think that it could probably have been cut down by an hour/an episode, but all things considered it was enjoyable.</p>\n<p>Today we finished up with Netflix's <a href=\"https://m.imdb.com/title/tt14403178/\">Beef</a>. We had watched the first episode the other day, and worked out way through the rest of them today. I really like all of the A24 stuff that I've seen, and this was not too bad either. Granted, the overall story is just insane enough...but then so was Eric.</p>\n<p>So far as other television stuff, I've got my YouTube TV set to record <em>all the Olympics</em> stuff, so I'll watch some of that in time. I'm more of a Winter fan than Summer, though.</p>\n<p>Of course we're also watching <a href=\"https://m.imdb.com/title/tt11198330/\">House of the Dragon</a> and <a href=\"https://m.imdb.com/title/tt1190634/\">The Boys</a>, as one is aught to do.</p>\n<h3 id=\"link-dump\">Link Dump <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#link-dump\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I think I can come up with a small handful of links this week, so let us see what's out there.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://kansasreflector.com/2024/07/28/spyware-turned-this-kansas-high-school-into-a-red-zone-of-dystopian-surveillance/\">Spyware turned this Kansas high school into a ‘red zone’ of dystopian surveillance</a> We had our own little run in with this particular piece of software last year as well, and I can't really honestly say that I'm a fan.

I can recall Magician Lord, Baseball Stars, 2020 Baseball, Samurai Showdown, I can't recall the others. I'd purchased the whole package over 20 years ago on eBay for less than $600.

It gets greased, or it gets replaced.</p>\n<p>Not to mention the fact that fitting I to a new clique can be extraordinarily difficult.</p>\n<p>Another thing that makes things challenging is that I'm not the most patient teacher, I think. Especially when it comes to how basic computer applications work. I do understand that I should do better here, do more teaching rather than taking over and doing.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of jobs out there these days that require basic skills - not to mention even getting an application submitted.

It always felt a little hypocritical of myself when I did this. There I sat, three hundred thirty plus pounds, knowing that I would never be able to be one of those with a success story of my own.</p>\n<p>Within weeks of starting keto, I knew that I wanted nothing more than to just be down a hundred pounds after one year.</p>\n<p>Well, I like to say that I basically turned that whole change into a game: how large of a calorie restriction could I maintain, how close to zero net carbs could I average?</p>\n<p>I blew way past that hundred pounds loss within that year and was already very close to my current weight already.</p>\n<p>My lowest weight was in the 168 pound ballpark. I'm a six foot two plus guy, and I know for a fact that that was too low. I did not look good.</p>\n<p>I have slowly worked back up to low 190s. Insofar as health goes, I know that's perfectly acceptable.</p>\n<p>But. Mentally, it is not good enough for me. I want 180s. For my mind, where I'm at is just too close to 200. I don't want to be there again.</p>\n<p>So, I know that I dropped the weight (I don't like to say I <em>lost</em> it, because I really don't want to <em>find</em> it again) really quickly. Probably not super healthily either. However, I have managed in many ways to change my relationship with food.</p>\n<p>I never really ate my feelings. It was more out of boredom than anything. Now, I really try to enjoy the feeling of looking better and use the extra time to read or work on some other self development process.</p>\n<p>If I have missed anything at all during this life change, it's that my hair is no longer thick and composed of ringlets (think Weird Al hair).
