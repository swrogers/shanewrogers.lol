      "content_html": "<p>What to say about today?</p>\n<p>Today is Juneteenth. This would be the first year that my place of employment has (I think...) provided those of us who are able to have the Holiday off, off. There are those who are declared as essential, so I would assume that they could have their Holiday moved, or just make the extra pay. I don't honestly know how that will work for this case.</p>\n<p>Me, being a white, caucasian, cis dude who is near half a century old at this point in his life...I can not help but just feel really kind of weird having this day off as a Holiday. Now, I absolutely do believe that it should be a Holiday, no doubt about that.</p>\n<p>It just feels strange for me, personally, to have the day out.</p>\n<p>Okay, that's about as political as I ever want to get.</p>\n<p>In other moments of not so much excitement, the power was off for an hour or so here.</p>\n<p>No idea what happened, but it did provide a moment to ponder and read a part of my newest book:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.some.pics/swrogers/6671c7a543862.jpg\" alt=\"Photo of book &quot;Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell&quot; by Susanna Clark. First Edition, First printing, US Edition, Black Cover.\"></p>\n<p>I remember watching the series of this when it aired a few years ago and thought that it might make a good read.</p>\n<p>I was grateful to have found a good hardback copy of the first printing/first US edition for a really good price.</p>\n<p>Here's to eventually getting it finished!</p>\n<p>This is post 4/100 of my #100DaysToOffload posts.

Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Woodstock, all of them! I've been enamored of the crew since I was a child.</p>\n<p>Some of my earliest memories of reading, not just making things up and babbling and looking at pictures, is of laying on the living room floor, the Sunday Comics spread open in front of me, reading and laughing at Peanuts.</p>\n<p>I remember Dad asking me if I was actually reading, then him being surprised when I said yep!</p>\n<p>All of that to say that my wife is pretty awesome! She always knows what to get me.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.some.pics/swrogers/6671b4a30cb0e.jpg\" alt=\"A Charlie Brown Squish Mellow. \"></p>\n<p>The best squishmellow of all time!</p>\n<p>This is post 3/100 of my #100DaysToOffload posts.

I have to say that I consider myself extremely fortunate to have a very flexible career that affords me the ability to take time when I need it. It is not something that need be done very often - not for myself anyhow - but I'm more than happy to take it.</p>\n<p>Currently, I'm sitting in the quiet of the dinning area, watching one of the kiddos make some kind of banana <em>slash</em> chocolate <em>slash</em> puff pastry dessert that he and Mom had seen online somewhere. It looks interesting, and I'm sure it'll be tasty for them.</p>\n<p>Did I mention that this kiddo is only just out of fifth grade? He's been baking and cooking for what seems like a couple of years now. The kiddo is very driven and fairly well rounded.</p>\n<p>Normally, anyhow. Sometimes these kids will surprise with some of those &quot;You asked what?!&quot; questions. They are all super intelligent, have gifted IEPs in school, but still - on occasion - they show their age and remind us that they are still children, and need guidance to make their way.</p>\n<p>And that is perfectly fine. It's what we are here for.</p>\n<p>This is post 2/100 of my #100DaysToOffload posts. You can read the other posts in this series <a href=\"/tags/100daystooffload\">here</a>.</p>\n",

It was a pretty good day. There were a couple of us that managed to get in a few good coaster rides, facilitated by some decently short lines.</p>\n<p>I had never ridden the Prowler before today - definitely one of my new faves. It's an older wooden coaster, I think it's celebrating a birthday this year as well. I'm kind of surprised that I had never been on it previously, but sure glad that I did.</p>\n<p>Now I've just got to get over the heat and sun induced ache that I've put myself through.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-sunday-linkdump\">The Sunday Linkdump <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#the-sunday-linkdump\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I don't really have a whole lot this week, as I've just not really had the time to go down too many rabbit holes this week.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tiltedwindmillpress.com/product/ryoms-preorder/\">Michael W Lucas' Run Your Own Mail server preorder</a> I've previously run my own mail server, sort of successfully, but not from scratch.
