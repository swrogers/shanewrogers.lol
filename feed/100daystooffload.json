But on the other hand, seeing as there were no plans to do anything I can't be disappointed that nothing got done!</p>\n<p>Win win for everybody on that one.</p>\n<p>The family did get out for the Fourth of July (non) event that was held in town. There was music (not that great), craft booths (not that great), food trucks (probably decent, but not our kind of nutrition), and a drone show.</p>\n<p>Oh, and a kids play area. Which was fun for the young one.</p>\n<p>We went for less than an hour and walked around to see what was what. Finding things not worth it, we left to go get the kids some ice cream cones.</p>\n<p>We did go back for the drone show, which was supposed to start at 9:45.</p>\n<p>Then it was supposed to start at 10:00. Then 10:30. 10:45. Then it was called at 11:00.</p>\n<p>At which time it started raining.</p>\n<p>Evidently, the vendor was having issues getting the show code loaded onto the 200 drones via their Verizon Wireless hotspot. They shoulda had T-Mobile. Ha.</p>\n<p>The weather had stunk all day, so they weren't able to do the pre-work earlier, either.</p>\n<p>Now, the city has a $30,000 credit for next year.</p>\n<p>We were really looking forward to seeing how it went, so I guess we'll check it out next year.</p>\n<p>This is post 14/100 of my #100DaysToOffload posts.

The kids seemed to enjoy themselves, and yet another year with no need to send anybody to the emergency room is a win in my book.</p>\n<p>This was also one of the cheaper years that we've managed to get away with, with a bill only just shy of two hundred.</p>\n<p>Yeah, we totally didn't need to spend the money.

It gets greased, or it gets replaced.</p>\n<p>Not to mention the fact that fitting I to a new clique can be extraordinarily difficult.</p>\n<p>Another thing that makes things challenging is that I'm not the most patient teacher, I think. Especially when it comes to how basic computer applications work. I do understand that I should do better here, do more teaching rather than taking over and doing.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of jobs out there these days that require basic skills - not to mention even getting an application submitted.

It always felt a little hypocritical of myself when I did this. There I sat, three hundred thirty plus pounds, knowing that I would never be able to be one of those with a success story of my own.</p>\n<p>Within weeks of starting keto, I knew that I wanted nothing more than to just be down a hundred pounds after one year.</p>\n<p>Well, I like to say that I basically turned that whole change into a game: how large of a calorie restriction could I maintain, how close to zero net carbs could I average?</p>\n<p>I blew way past that hundred pounds loss within that year and was already very close to my current weight already.</p>\n<p>My lowest weight was in the 168 pound ballpark. I'm a six foot two plus guy, and I know for a fact that that was too low. I did not look good.</p>\n<p>I have slowly worked back up to low 190s. Insofar as health goes, I know that's perfectly acceptable.</p>\n<p>But. Mentally, it is not good enough for me. I want 180s. For my mind, where I'm at is just too close to 200. I don't want to be there again.</p>\n<p>So, I know that I dropped the weight (I don't like to say I <em>lost</em> it, because I really don't want to <em>find</em> it again) really quickly. Probably not super healthily either. However, I have managed in many ways to change my relationship with food.</p>\n<p>I never really ate my feelings. It was more out of boredom than anything. Now, I really try to enjoy the feeling of looking better and use the extra time to read or work on some other self development process.</p>\n<p>If I have missed anything at all during this life change, it's that my hair is no longer thick and composed of ringlets (think Weird Al hair).

      "content_html": "<p>First day back is now in the bag!</p>\n<p>Not nearly as bad as those times when I take two weeks off (FSM knows that those both make me want to never take another vacation <strong>and</strong> never go back to work again) but there was still a bit of cleanup and catch up to do.</p>\n<p>Some of the cleanup involves coming back in to work post fiscal year end, when it's not necessarily been completely opened back up. Not a huge deal, but still needs to be taken care of.</p>\n<p>There is also the metric arse ton of email to sift through. Although I'll be honest and say that I do continue to keep my work email synching through my phone and delete most of the crap that doesn't pertain to me.</p>\n<p>Sue me. I don't like surprises.</p>\n<p>What was best today, though, was not one but <em>TWO</em> Monday morning meetings.</p>\n<p>Back to back.</p>\n<p>Right up there with Friday afternoon meetings with my favorites.</p>\n<p>Fortunately these are extremely rare for me and Mondays are generally pretty tame.</p>\n<p>Well, I'm thinking it's getting close to dinner time and I haven't yet figured out what to feed the kids - I probably ought to take that under consideration.</p>\n<p>Until next time.</p>\n<p>This is post 15/100 of my #100DaysToOffload posts.
