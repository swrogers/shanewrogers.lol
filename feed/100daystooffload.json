      "content_html": "<p>It has been a couple of uneventful days, which if I'm being honest is not such a bad thing.</p>\n<p>Work has been moving along at a nice steady pace, with some progress being made on the good old Team Dynamix front.</p>\n<p>On that, I shall say that my enthusiasm has been ever so tempered at this point. There does not seem to be a path forward for our department to be able to have the type of control that we would like, nor some of the project management features that some would hope for.</p>\n<p>We shall, however, make due.</p>\n<p>Next week will be an off week for me. Yet another week of vacation.</p>\n<p>Most people would be super stoked and excited about that, I'm sure, but if you're a reader of my past posts you might know that I'm not a fan.</p>\n<p>However, my wife also has next week off - so maybe we can get out and hit a local park or something with the kids. Take advantage of those uber expensive passes we have.</p>\n<p>What we really should do, though, is work on getting our extra bedroom set back up for the eldest kiddo. Along with the rest of the home. We are considering getting licensed by the State for an in-home childcare center. To do that will require a little bit of setup but totally worth it.</p>\n<p>Of course, I know for a fact what we'll <em>actually</em> do next week. Absolutely nothing. Apart from doing stuff with the kids for the Fourth of July.</p>\n<p>Here's to a good rest of the week.</p>\n<p>This is post 8/100 of my #100DaysToOffload posts.

      "content_html": "<p>When I was in middle school, in what now seems like half a million years ago, a friend and I started writing stories.</p>\n<p>We each had a single subject notebook and filled them with what were - to us anyhow, at the time - fantastically interesting tales.</p>\n<p>I can't recall what stories my friend had written about (and, sadly, cancer has taken him) but mine was some kind of   space opera mash up with robots and power suits and who knows what all else.</p>\n<p>I'm sure that it was all horribly juvenile, but it felt really grandiose to me at the time.</p>\n<p>My Mom even read what I had one at one point and did say that it was pretty good. Of course, as a parent you are a little biased.</p>\n<p>She was - is? - well read, however, and did encourage me to read a large variety of works. I still have that love of reading.</p>\n<p>There are far too many conversations going on in this house, I can not recall where I was going with any of these thoughts.</p>\n<p>Oh, yes. Writing. Write anything. I've seen a lot of posts from people recently who struggled to start writing, who thought that people would not want to read what they had to say.</p>\n<p>Does any of that matter? No.</p>\n<p>When writing for yourself, it matters not what your getting down. It doesn't matter if you think it's &quot;juvenile&quot; or otherwise uninteresting - you are writing for yourself.</p>\n<p>It matters not if my readership is a party of one.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-link-dump\">The Link Dump <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#the-link-dump\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Now for the Sunday link dump.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wand3r.net/adding-a-reply-on-mastodon-to-each-post/\">Add a Reply on Mastodon Link</a> Brandon has a pretty good idea using a new feature of omg.lol's version perma-urls and redirects that I might see about adopting here.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://michal.sapka.me/blog/2024/leaving-firefix-behind/\">Michal is looking for a new browser</a> what with all the ad (and ai, and -nauseam) nonsense that's going around these days, is there any wonder that people are looking to move on from the behemoths?

      "content_html": "<p>I know that I have previously written on my struggle to work on maintaining my weight, as well as some of the body and confidence issues that go along with that.</p>\n<p>We shall count today's journal entry as yet another one of those.</p>\n<p>Within the next two months, August 8th I believe, will the the fifth year milestone of living a keto lifestyle.</p>\n<p>Before that, I remember sitting in my office chair and watching these amazing transformation videos of people. It always felt a little hypocritical of myself when I did this. There I sat, three hundred thirty plus pounds, knowing that I would never be able to be one of those with a success story of my own.</p>\n<p>Within weeks of starting keto, I knew that I wanted nothing more than to just be down a hundred pounds after one year.</p>\n<p>Well, I like to say that I basically turned that whole change into a game: how large of a calorie restriction could I maintain, how close to zero net carbs could I average?</p>\n<p>I blew way past that hundred pounds loss within that year and was already very close to my current weight already.</p>\n<p>My lowest weight was in the 168 pound ballpark. I'm a six foot two plus guy, and I know for a fact that that was too low. I did not look good.</p>\n<p>I have slowly worked back up to low 190s. Insofar as health goes, I know that's perfectly acceptable.</p>\n<p>But. Mentally, it is not good enough for me. I want 180s. For my mind, where I'm at is just too close to 200. I don't want to be there again.</p>\n<p>So, I know that I dropped the weight (I don't like to say I <em>lost</em> it, because I really don't want to <em>find</em> it again) really quickly. Probably not super healthily either. However, I have managed in many ways to change my relationship with food.</p>\n<p>I never really ate my feelings. It was more out of boredom than anything. Now, I really try to enjoy the feeling of looking better and use the extra time to read or work on some other self development process.</p>\n<p>If I have missed anything at all during this life change, it's that my hair is no longer thick and composed of ringlets (think Weird Al hair). That's about the only thing I miss. But, it could be age related as well.</p>\n<p>Today has been a good day, thus far, when it comes to food.

This would be the first year that my place of employment has (I think...) provided those of us who are able to have the Holiday off, off. There are those who are declared as essential, so I would assume that they could have their Holiday moved, or just make the extra pay. I don't honestly know how that will work for this case.</p>\n<p>Me, being a white, caucasian, cis dude who is near half a century old at this point in his life...I can not help but just feel really kind of weird having this day off as a Holiday.

He's been baking and cooking for what seems like a couple of years now. The kiddo is very driven and fairly well rounded.</p>\n<p>Normally, anyhow.
