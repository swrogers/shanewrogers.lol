      "content_html": "<p>Not much of an interesting week, this one.</p>\n<p>I've been meaning to try to get something down and posted but it's been a week of zero motivation.</p>\n<p>I haven't even mowed the lawn in two weekends at this point. Fortunately I don't think I <em>need</em> to mow yet, but I probably will before the season is out.</p>\n<p>One of the twins was able to participate in the first cross country event this season and he did pretty well! I would like to be able to run with him, but I'm not there yet.</p>\n<p>I still try to take my lunch hour excursions and walk. Generally I can get in just under three miles in about forty minutes. Then a quick shower before logging back in to work.</p>\n<p>My goal still remains to run a 5K. I'm sure I'll get there.</p>\n<p>I had ordered the <em>Run Your Own Mail Server</em> book, by Michael W Lewis, towards the end of the pre-order period and it finally arrived this week! I've run mail servers for myself in the past, generally through systems like <a href=\"https://mailinabox.email/\">mail on a box</a> or <a href=\"https://yunohost.org/\">yunonost</a>. I think even at one point I had set up <a href=\"http://www.qmailtoaster.net/\">qmail toaster</a>.</p>\n<p>But it's nice to know more about the what's and the why's, and it looks like this most excellent book is going to help out in that department. I don't know that I'll set something up from scratch... But that is certainly an itch.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.some.pics/swrogers/66de154608ac5.jpg\" alt=\"The book: Run Your Own Mail Server, by Michael W Lucas\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"linkdump\">Linkdump <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#linkdump\">#</a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sigops.org/2024/the-moral-implications-of-being-a-moderately-successful-computer-scientist-and-a-woman/\">The Moral Implications of Being a Moderately Successful Computer Scientist and a Woman</a><br>\nI have not read this one yet, but it's certainly high on my list.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://cleoinvestigation.notion.site/Investigating-Cleo-0796ef7ce8464a90ba388cdb68e08eef\">Investigating Cleo</a><br>\nIt's always entertaining to read about who mysterious anonymous posters might be, even if there is no real need or desire to dox anyone.

Anything.</p>\n<p>It's not like I've been lazy today, either. Woke up, made my mug of coffee. Cleaned out the floor of our &quot;soon to be coat&quot; closet. Emptied the dishwasher. Filled the dishwasher. Ran the dishwasher. Took my first sip of coffee.</p>\n<p>Still there are so many things that need to be done. Or, that I feel should be done.</p>\n<p>I should mow the lawn, for example.</p>\n<p>I can't get motivated today.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-weekend\">The weekend <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#the-weekend\">#</a></h3>\n<p>We had a pretty decent weekend I guess.</p>\n<p>Saturday was a birthday party for the daughter of a friend. Our little man enjoys going over there, so it was a good time.</p>\n<p>Sunday was the penultimate day for the local water park to be open this year, so we went out that direction. I didn't go there as I'm not as big a fan, but the wife and the little did go and seemed to enjoy the day.</p>\n<p>Myself and the eldest twin went to the amusement park side. It was really pretty good, not too hot, not too many people. We were able to get in half a dozen rides in - mostly coasters - within a handful of hours.</p>\n<p>Any time you don't have to spend three hours in a single line is a good day.</p>\n<p>Afterwards, we met up and had dinner in the the amusement park so the little guy could ride some stuff too.</p>\n<p>Then the adults got to eat.</p>\n<p>It was a successful trip, all in all.</p>\n<p>We'll be back in a couple of weeks for the halloween haunts they set up.

At the park, I didn't even get in too bad a shape until towards the end, and to be realistic I was actually cold.</p>\n<p>It goes along with water and not having a large amount of body fat these days. Something of a side effect I suppose.</p>\n<p>After spending some time with the kiddos in the wave pool, we headed over to the adjoining amusement park and fed the family.

      "content_html": "<p>I did not post anything yesterday.</p>\n<p>After over a month of managing to get something put up, I skipped a day.</p>\n<p>And you know what? That's okay.</p>\n<p>It's not a habit until it becomes something more normal. I hope that days like yesterday are more the exception than the rule.</p>\n<p>There was some productivity that was had yesterday, despite the overnight rain I was able to get the lawn mowed and some other weeds taken care of. We've got an older Snapper battery operated lawnmower, and I consider it a major accomplishment if I'm able to get the lawn mowed within a single 4Ah battery. If I can get it weekly, it's usually possible, and only takes about an hour.</p>\n<p>Still, I really need to run the weed eater though.</p>\n<p>The second vehicle is still at the dealership, hopefully it's finished by Monday afternoon. It really stinks not having my car. Not that I go anywhere, or that I could go anywhere at this time. But still.</p>\n<p>I've got a question into our insurance agent, wondering about a few things that are related about that vehicle issue, but I'm not overly optimistic about any responses there. Certainly nothing favorable, anyway.</p>\n<p>It's getting close to that time to begin thinking about birthday gifts for the spouse. Sometimes I'm just not really in a gift giving mood, and this seems to be one of those times. I do, however, think I know what I'm going to get, so that's positive.</p>\n<h3 id=\"last-week's-links\">Last Week's Links <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#last-week's-links\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I think I'm going to start something new here, too, this week.

You'd think that Google would at least provide some kind of <em>search</em> for theirs, but.... That's asking quite a lot.
