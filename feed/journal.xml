		  &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s crazy the stuff that I have packaged up and toted along with me throughout all of my moves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&#39;s even crazier are the items that I &lt;em&gt;didn&#39;t&lt;/em&gt; bring along with me, for some reason or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Items like video games. Lots of cartridges and disks, cases and manuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games that I wouldn&#39;t mind playing again on my SEGA Genesis/SEGA CD/32X (yeah, I had the SEGA Stack....) or Super NES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s always a &amp;quot;but&amp;quot;, isn&#39;t there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I actually &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; any of those here with me? No, of course not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do have my boxed Dreamcast and some high profile games, but not the older stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, I&#39;ll probably never see those things again, either. Last year I made the couple hour trek back to my childhood home, with the hope that I could bring some stuff back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father (whom I love immensely) had moved an entire home full of &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt; into a couple of self built storage buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was heart broken. Having seen a couple of the figures that I still could find completely covered in dust and dirt and everything, and some electronics just in tatters...the weather had done them no favors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the items that I was hoping to find (including multiple unopened, complete on card figures) was a complete in box Neo Geo AES with two sticks, memory cards and six games (I think). I can recall Magician Lord, Baseball Stars, 2020 Baseball, Samurai Showdown, I can&#39;t recall the others. I&#39;d purchased the whole package over 20 years ago on eBay for less than $600. Good luck trying to find anything similar these days for twice that. This gutted me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, as I attempt to go through a boatload of boxes, I just have to ask myself: Why would you bring bits and pieces of this stuff, and not the actual decks that make these things work?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gah!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Vendors Gonna Vendor</title>
		<link href="https://shanewrogers.lol/posts/vendors-gonna-vendor/"/>
		<updated>2024-07-17T17:22:01+00:00</updated>
		<id>https://shanewrogers.lol/posts/vendors-gonna-vendor/</id>
		<content type="html">
		  &lt;p&gt;There are a handful of things that I don&#39;t understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one, why can&#39;t certain vendors let their customers know that the product that they depend on for their day to day usage was not actually patched to the current patch level on the scheduled time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only was the time scheduled, but it was of course scheduled by the vendor, seeing as how the customer is basically at the mercy of said vendor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only did the customer (us) have to check to ensure that the product was patched, but then the customer (us, again) has to contact &lt;em&gt;big vendor&lt;/em&gt; support to ask why it wasn&#39;t patched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why can&#39;t they just pop some kind of email notification that says it was either successful or not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then if not - what the plan of action is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. We asked this question on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was out sick on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; response we&#39;ve had thus far was an incorrect notice that none of our instances have been patched at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have three instances: one each for development, testing and production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our development instance had already been patched, as scheduled, so I got to let the vendor know that...um, no, I don&#39;t believe that&#39;s correct please don&#39;t re-patch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow - now the vendor has let us know that it&#39;s time to board the patching train because they&#39;ve scheduled the production instance for updating next week, when we haven&#39;t had a chance to do &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; testing in the test instance. Which is less of a playground than dev.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s beyond infuriating.&lt;/p&gt;

		  &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s Sunday. Whatever that means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end of the weekend and the beginning of a new week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently we&#39;re just taking in the time to watch the youngest play in a local indoor jungle gym. It&#39;s a friends birthday party for the little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far as Sundays go, it&#39;s actually been a moderately busy one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boys and I got haircuts. We went to the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spent some time at the local splash pad. Definitely a decent way for the little to cool off, but still.... really hot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drove around town for a bit, mainly due to having forgotten when the party started. Ha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it&#39;s all about figuring dinner out. Although I think we&#39;ll let the older kiddos fend for themselves with leftovers and pasta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;link-dump&quot;&gt;Link Dump &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#link-dump&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been a bit lapse on this listing, but then I&#39;m just not too certain that what I&#39;ve always got is worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/shipt&quot;&gt;https://spectrum.ieee.org/shipt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Shipt&#39;s pay algorithm screwing people over. The gig workers weren&#39;t gonna have it, so they took things into their own hands to crack open that black box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/2024/07/08/johns-hopkins-bloomberg-donation&quot;&gt;https://www.axios.com/2024/07/08/johns-hopkins-bloomberg-donation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
John&#39;s Hopkins medical school to be free for most students. This is just amazing. An excellent example of the good that can be done via philanthropy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.webology.dev/2024/07/12/duckdb-may-be.html&quot;&gt;https://micro.webology.dev/2024/07/12/duckdb-may-be.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Jeff Triplett has a neat example using DuckDB to pull metadata from YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;

SSH as a replacement for sudo. This is an interesting idea, certainly with a few hoops. I wonder about setting this up...?&lt;/p&gt;

Mainly for my future use, lots of imports and exports for Vivaldi.&lt;/p&gt;

		  &lt;p&gt;Sometimes I wonder how in the world I managed to write a new post every day during the previous challenge that I subjected myself to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week has thus far been fairly non eventful. Boredom is a good thing sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I made a purchase that I almost regret doing. Even though it&#39;s an item that gets daily use, and I&#39;m in it probably eight plus hours a day, which kind of makes it a necessity, I&#39;m not a hundred percent happy with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously it&#39;s some kind of work from home item. It&#39;s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.staples.com/union-scale-flexfit-hyken-ergonomic-mesh-swivel-task-chair-black-un59460/product_990119?cid=EM:ordconfrm::sku&amp;amp;&quot;&gt;Hyken Mesh Chair&lt;/a&gt; from Staples. The one thing that I&#39;m not happy with is the &amp;quot;headrest&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the quotes there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it&#39;s not super adjustable, this headrest comes all the way up to in between my shoulder blades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless I crouch down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which I am not going to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately I can remove it, which I&#39;ll probably do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that, it&#39;s an okay chair for those who don&#39;t have or can&#39;t afford to get the kick arse Herman Miller Aeron. Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah well, back to the grind!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>First Day Back</title>

		<content type="html">
		  &lt;p&gt;First day back is now in the bag!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not nearly as bad as those times when I take two weeks off (FSM knows that those both make me want to never take another vacation &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; never go back to work again) but there was still a bit of cleanup and catch up to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the cleanup involves coming back in to work post fiscal year end, when it&#39;s not necessarily been completely opened back up. Not a huge deal, but still needs to be taken care of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also the metric arse ton of email to sift through. Although I&#39;ll be honest and say that I do continue to keep my work email synching through my phone and delete most of the crap that doesn&#39;t pertain to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sue me. I don&#39;t like surprises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was best today, though, was not one but &lt;em&gt;TWO&lt;/em&gt; Monday morning meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right up there with Friday afternoon meetings with my favorites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately these are extremely rare for me and Mondays are generally pretty tame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s getting close to dinner time and I haven&#39;t yet figured out what to feed the kids - I probably ought to take that under consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time.&lt;/p&gt;

		  &lt;p&gt;Does Sunday count as a vacation day, ergo being the last day of a vacation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&#39;t say that I&#39;ve ever actually counted the weekends in my vacation, but I suppose they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow is return to work day. We&#39;ll put &amp;quot;return&amp;quot; in quotes, seeing as I work from home and it&#39;s not like we actually left home over the last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were no plans set out for the week, so nothing was accomplished. But on the other hand, seeing as there were no plans to do anything I can&#39;t be disappointed that nothing got done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Win win for everybody on that one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family did get out for the Fourth of July (non) event that was held in town. There was music (not that great), craft booths (not that great), food trucks (probably decent, but not our kind of nutrition), and a drone show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and a kids play area. Which was fun for the young one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went for less than an hour and walked around to see what was what. Finding things not worth it, we left to go get the kids some ice cream cones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did go back for the drone show, which was supposed to start at 9:45.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it was supposed to start at 10:00. Then 10:30. 10:45. Then it was called at 11:00.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At which time it started raining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidently, the vendor was having issues getting the show code loaded onto the 200 drones via their Verizon Wireless hotspot. They shoulda had T-Mobile. Ha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weather had stunk all day, so they weren&#39;t able to do the pre-work earlier, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the city has a $30,000 credit for next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were really looking forward to seeing how it went, so I guess we&#39;ll check it out next year.&lt;/p&gt;

		  &lt;p&gt;Happy Fourth of July, for those that celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet another Holiday here in the States where we, basically, get to set our wallets on fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite literally in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will admit that this is one of my favorite days of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is currently just after 22:30 Central time, we just finished up with our small handful of fountains and sprinklers. The kids seemed to enjoy themselves, and yet another year with no need to send anybody to the emergency room is a win in my book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was also one of the cheaper years that we&#39;ve managed to get away with, with a bill only just shy of two hundred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, we totally didn&#39;t need to spend the money. But think of the kids! Especially the six year old who lives for the smoke bombs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still more than I&#39;d like to spend for an hours worth of entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, we will be back to a double income family soon. Super nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time!&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">
		  &lt;p&gt;First day of vacation and I&#39;m already sick and tired of it. &lt;em&gt;Note: it&#39;s now the second day, but my feelings haven&#39;t changed much here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe one of these times I can actually plan to go somewhere or do something, get away from things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just don&#39;t get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These things should be enjoyable, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does it help that most of the people - it seems - in this home are depressed? I&#39;m gonna go with a &amp;quot;No sir, not one bit&amp;quot; on that one my friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve got one adult who is dealing with a loss of something that never should have happened in the first place (something that never should have to to fruition to have &lt;em&gt;been lost&lt;/em&gt;, that is). Another adult dealing with their own family issues, which are by their nature spilling over into the home life. Kids who we are trying to keep from becoming depressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m walking on eggshells around here, and it&#39;s extremely tiring.&lt;/p&gt;

		  &lt;p&gt;What a week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week was quite a ride. The weekend hasn&#39;t been much different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look through a few job listings, not only for my spouse but - potentially - for myself as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, not that I&#39;m looking to replace my current job, but perhaps more to supplement what I do have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as the spouse goes, well, sometimes I feel like I&#39;m kind of limited. She is great with children and youths, not so much with peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s her perfectionism and drive to do things by the book. Which, in and of itself is not so much a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when you are around a new group of coworkers who have been doing things the same way for &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt;, well, then that can be a little dicey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not always good to be that squeaky wheel. It gets greased, or it gets replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to mention the fact that fitting I to a new clique can be extraordinarily difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing that makes things challenging is that I&#39;m not the most patient teacher, I think. Especially when it comes to how basic computer applications work. I do understand that I should do better here, do more teaching rather than taking over and doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of jobs out there these days that require basic skills - not to mention even getting an application submitted. I get frustrated far too easily, sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter what she does, though, I completely will be here to support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All things said, even hobbies can make some extra money. There have been plenty of ideas in this home, plenty of supplies have been purchased, now there is also an abundance of time.&lt;/p&gt;

		  &lt;p&gt;I had something written up earlier that I was going to post, but as is often the case in life things change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it always for the best?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find that I am, for the first time in a very long time, contemplating the need to do one of two things: either procure a second income, or find another income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither of which is something that I desire to any degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like what I do and I like where I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However. Something something life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess it&#39;s time to take stock of what my abilities are and what I&#39;m capable of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will very soon be down to a single income in the home. More or less. I do suppose that the older kiddo does have a paycheck, but he has his own set of problems to take care of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One really has to hope that this situation does not last longer than it needs to, and, perhaps, it can be used to open some doors for another opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like now there should be plenty of people hours available to work on getting the home straight for that in-home childcare plan that was mentioned previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a silver lining?&lt;/p&gt;

		  &lt;p&gt;It has been a couple of uneventful days, which if I&#39;m being honest is not such a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work has been moving along at a nice steady pace, with some progress being made on the good old Team Dynamix front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that, I shall say that my enthusiasm has been ever so tempered at this point. There does not seem to be a path forward for our department to be able to have the type of control that we would like, nor some of the project management features that some would hope for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We shall, however, make due.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week will be an off week for me. Yet another week of vacation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people would be super stoked and excited about that, I&#39;m sure, but if you&#39;re a reader of my past posts you might know that I&#39;m not a fan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, my wife also has next week off - so maybe we can get out and hit a local park or something with the kids. Take advantage of those uber expensive passes we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we really should do, though, is work on getting our extra bedroom set back up for the eldest kiddo. Along with the rest of the home. We are considering getting licensed by the State for an in-home childcare center. To do that will require a little bit of setup but totally worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I know for a fact what we&#39;ll &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; do next week. Absolutely nothing. Apart from doing stuff with the kids for the Fourth of July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s to a good rest of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is post 8/100 of my #100DaysToOffload posts. You can read the other posts in this series &lt;a href=&quot;https://shanewrogers.lol/tags/100daystooffload&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Single Party</title>

		<content type="html">
		  &lt;p&gt;When I was in middle school, in what now seems like half a million years ago, a friend and I started writing stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We each had a single subject notebook and filled them with what were - to us anyhow, at the time - fantastically interesting tales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&#39;t recall what stories my friend had written about (and, sadly, cancer has taken him) but mine was some kind of   space opera mash up with robots and power suits and who knows what all else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m sure that it was all horribly juvenile, but it felt really grandiose to me at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Mom even read what I had one at one point and did say that it was pretty good. Of course, as a parent you are a little biased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was - is? - well read, however, and did encourage me to read a large variety of works. I still have that love of reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are far too many conversations going on in this house, I can not recall where I was going with any of these thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, yes. Writing. Write anything. I&#39;ve seen a lot of posts from people recently who struggled to start writing, who thought that people would not want to read what they had to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does any of that matter? No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When writing for yourself, it matters not what your getting down. It doesn&#39;t matter if you think it&#39;s &amp;quot;juvenile&amp;quot; or otherwise uninteresting - you are writing for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It matters not if my readership is a party of one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-link-dump&quot;&gt;The Link Dump &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#the-link-dump&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the Sunday link dump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wand3r.net/adding-a-reply-on-mastodon-to-each-post/&quot;&gt;Add a Reply on Mastodon Link&lt;/a&gt; Brandon has a pretty good idea using a new feature of omg.lol&#39;s version perma-urls and redirects that I might see about adopting here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://michal.sapka.me/blog/2024/leaving-firefix-behind/&quot;&gt;Michal is looking for a new browser&lt;/a&gt; what with all the ad (and ai, and -nauseam) nonsense that&#39;s going around these days, is there any wonder that people are looking to move on from the behemoths? I&#39;ve tried nyxt, it&#39;s interesting and different, but I&#39;m thinking I might move to Librewolf.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I didn&#39;t have much linkage for this week. I&#39;ve just not been spending much time going down the rabbit holes lately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time.&lt;/p&gt;

		  &lt;p&gt;I figured that today would be a good time to post something a little more lighthearted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I present some of the artwork of my youngest kiddo, which is basically overtaking all of the free space of the fridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that there is a problem with that, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Food and Weight Again</title>
		<link href="https://shanewrogers.lol/posts/food-and-weight-again/"/>
		<updated>2024-06-20T21:05:11+00:00</updated>
		<id>https://shanewrogers.lol/posts/food-and-weight-again/</id>
		<content type="html">
		  &lt;p&gt;I know that I have previously written on my struggle to work on maintaining my weight, as well as some of the body and confidence issues that go along with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We shall count today&#39;s journal entry as yet another one of those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the next two months, August 8th I believe, will the the fifth year milestone of living a keto lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before that, I remember sitting in my office chair and watching these amazing transformation videos of people. It always felt a little hypocritical of myself when I did this. There I sat, three hundred thirty plus pounds, knowing that I would never be able to be one of those with a success story of my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within weeks of starting keto, I knew that I wanted nothing more than to just be down a hundred pounds after one year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I like to say that I basically turned that whole change into a game: how large of a calorie restriction could I maintain, how close to zero net carbs could I average?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I blew way past that hundred pounds loss within that year and was already very close to my current weight already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My lowest weight was in the 168 pound ballpark. I&#39;m a six foot two plus guy, and I know for a fact that that was too low. I did not look good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have slowly worked back up to low 190s. Insofar as health goes, I know that&#39;s perfectly acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But. Mentally, it is not good enough for me. I want 180s. For my mind, where I&#39;m at is just too close to 200. I don&#39;t want to be there again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I know that I dropped the weight (I don&#39;t like to say I &lt;em&gt;lost&lt;/em&gt; it, because I really don&#39;t want to &lt;em&gt;find&lt;/em&gt; it again) really quickly. Probably not super healthily either. However, I have managed in many ways to change my relationship with food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never really ate my feelings. It was more out of boredom than anything. Now, I really try to enjoy the feeling of looking better and use the extra time to read or work on some other self development process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I have missed anything at all during this life change, it&#39;s that my hair is no longer thick and composed of ringlets (think Weird Al hair). That&#39;s about the only thing I miss. But, it could be age related as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today has been a good day, thus far, when it comes to food. Here&#39;s to keeping on.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Power Or Lack Thereof</title>

		  &lt;p&gt;What to say about today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is Juneteenth. This would be the first year that my place of employment has (I think...) provided those of us who are able to have the Holiday off, off. There are those who are declared as essential, so I would assume that they could have their Holiday moved, or just make the extra pay. I don&#39;t honestly know how that will work for this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me, being a white, caucasian, cis dude who is near half a century old at this point in his life...I can not help but just feel really kind of weird having this day off as a Holiday. Now, I absolutely do believe that it should be a Holiday, no doubt about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It just feels strange for me, personally, to have the day out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, that&#39;s about as political as I ever want to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other moments of not so much excitement, the power was off for an hour or so here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No idea what happened, but it did provide a moment to ponder and read a part of my newest book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.some.pics/swrogers/6671c7a543862.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photo of book &amp;quot;Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell&amp;quot; by Susanna Clark. First Edition, First printing, US Edition, Black Cover.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember watching the series of this when it aired a few years ago and thought that it might make a good read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was grateful to have found a good hardback copy of the first printing/first US edition for a really good price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s to eventually getting it finished!&lt;/p&gt;

		  &lt;p&gt;I am notoriously difficult to purchase any kind of gift for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything that I generally want, I have a tendency to go ahead and make the purchase at any and every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything that I &lt;em&gt;don&#39;t&lt;/em&gt; immediately buy, is most likely because the item just cost too much and I can not justify the purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do have a few things that I enjoy though, and high on that list is anything and everything Peanuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_M._Schulz&quot;&gt;Charles Schulz&lt;/a&gt; variety, of course. Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Woodstock, all of them! I&#39;ve been enamored of the crew since I was a child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of my earliest memories of reading, not just making things up and babbling and looking at pictures, is of laying on the living room floor, the Sunday Comics spread open in front of me, reading and laughing at Peanuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember Dad asking me if I was actually reading, then him being surprised when I said yep!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of that to say that my wife is pretty awesome! She always knows what to get me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.some.pics/swrogers/6671b4a30cb0e.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Charlie Brown Squish Mellow. &quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best squishmellow of all time!&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">
		  &lt;p&gt;Last night my head was killing me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning my head was still killing me. I have to say that I consider myself extremely fortunate to have a very flexible career that affords me the ability to take time when I need it. It is not something that need be done very often - not for myself anyhow - but I&#39;m more than happy to take it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, I&#39;m sitting in the quiet of the dinning area, watching one of the kiddos make some kind of banana &lt;em&gt;slash&lt;/em&gt; chocolate &lt;em&gt;slash&lt;/em&gt; puff pastry dessert that he and Mom had seen online somewhere. It looks interesting, and I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be tasty for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did I mention that this kiddo is only just out of fifth grade? He&#39;s been baking and cooking for what seems like a couple of years now. The kiddo is very driven and fairly well rounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, anyhow. Sometimes these kids will surprise with some of those &amp;quot;You asked what?!&amp;quot; questions. They are all super intelligent, have gifted IEPs in school, but still - on occasion - they show their age and remind us that they are still children, and need guidance to make their way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is perfectly fine. It&#39;s what we are here for.&lt;/p&gt;

		  &lt;p&gt;As today prepares to come to an end, I&#39;m sitting here at home waiting on the ibuprofen and acetaminophen cocktail to do its thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did make it to Worlds Of Fun, as a way to have a fun Father&#39;s Day. It was a pretty good day. There were a couple of us that managed to get in a few good coaster rides, facilitated by some decently short lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had never ridden the Prowler before today - definitely one of my new faves. It&#39;s an older wooden coaster, I think it&#39;s celebrating a birthday this year as well. I&#39;m kind of surprised that I had never been on it previously, but sure glad that I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I&#39;ve just got to get over the heat and sun induced ache that I&#39;ve put myself through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-sunday-linkdump&quot;&gt;The Sunday Linkdump &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#the-sunday-linkdump&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t really have a whole lot this week, as I&#39;ve just not really had the time to go down too many rabbit holes this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tiltedwindmillpress.com/product/ryoms-preorder/&quot;&gt;Michael W Lucas&#39; Run Your Own Mail server preorder&lt;/a&gt; I&#39;ve previously run my own mail server, sort of successfully, but not from scratch. This book is on my radar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.phrack.org/index.html&quot;&gt;Phrack Magazine&lt;/a&gt; Somebody had brought up 2600 magazine awhile ago, and this is another (non printed) magazine that&#39;s dedicated to the scene. I&#39;ve read 2600 for decades, and also enjoy reading this one when it&#39;s available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I say, not a lot this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;end-stuff&quot;&gt;End stuff &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#end-stuff&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m going to consider this my first entry into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://100daystooffload.com/&quot;&gt;#100DaysToOffload&lt;/a&gt; challenge for the next 365 days. I don&#39;t have any special pages set up for these, besides using the hashtag.&lt;/p&gt;

		  &lt;p&gt;Happy Father&#39;s Day Eve!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To all of those who are parent figures to somebody or other who needs the support or the assistance, here&#39;s to a day filled with the joy and happiness that goes along with that personal fulfillment!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a father figure to my kiddos, I have cherished every day I&#39;ve been around them. Have they all been easy days? Oh, heck no. But even those difficult and challenging days are completely worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, on to today&#39;s stuff!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that I&#39;ve got anything really special to impart today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was supposed to rain today, so the first thing I did upon waking up was head out and get the lawn mowed. It takes about an hour, so long as I&#39;m able to keep up on it every week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve got an old Snapper battery operated mower, with a 4Ah and a 2Ah battery pair. I really love it when I can get things done within a single battery. This morning was no different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the battery operated mower is nice and we don&#39;t have to put up with having a gasoline container in the garage, it does entail the need to mow more often. Otherwise you wind up with a field that the poor machine just can&#39;t deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did it wind up raining? Of course not. It looked pretty gnarly though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll rain tomorrow though. That would be perfect, especially since we plan on heading to World&#39;s Of Fun for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I&#39;m considering doing the whole &lt;a href=&quot;https://100daystooffload.com/&quot;&gt;100 Days To Offload&lt;/a&gt; challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figure that since I&#39;m trying to write more that it might be something worth doing. I like personal challenges of this sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, until next time.&lt;/p&gt;

		  &lt;p&gt;This morning, the vehicle was taken into the local big box retailer that also happens to have a tire and lube department. Supposedly they can also check batteries, but honestly I don&#39;t know how much I&#39;d trust them to even unlock a vehicle if you handed them the keys and a YouTube video with instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is coming from a person who used to be a salary manager at this store. So, yeah, when you&#39;ve worked there and seen that the department has had to replace two engines because reasons - you lose what little faith there was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where was I? Oh, yes, the vehicle was taken into this store to get the battery checked and maybe replaced. Evidently, they checked the battery and it was fine. I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t know, though. The car is over 36 months old, so in my opinion I think we should replace the thing. It&#39;s spendy, but I&#39;d rather not get stranded. I suppose that I&#39;ll just keep the mobile jumper in it. Charged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spouse drove it around to her appointments today as well and has said that it did not act up. I would like to follow through with some plans we had for this weekend and go to the local amusement park - but I&#39;ve got trust issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been known to basically be done with my car at the onset of issues. Seems bad, but, it is what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-stuff&quot;&gt;Other Stuff &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#other-stuff&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve been watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.imdb.com/title/tt12637874/&quot;&gt;Fallout&lt;/a&gt; over the past week. Not too bad, certainly looking forward to seeing where it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t know what we&#39;ll watch next, but it&#39;s not for lack of content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kingdom Hearts came out on Steam. I had not intended on buying the bundle...but I bought the bundle. Of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I really do think that I like my blogging set up and workflow here, the tinkerer in me just can&#39;t leave well enough alone. I&#39;ve set up a small digitalocean droplet and installed &lt;a href=&quot;https://withknown.com/&quot;&gt;Known&lt;/a&gt; once again. I like it, but I&#39;m just not sure that I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; it. I&#39;ll probably stick with what I&#39;ve got.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s hard to beat flat text files and markdown.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Our feline friend</title>

		<content type="html">
		  &lt;p&gt;Let me begin today by first stating that I love our cat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m a cat person, more than any other animal. Please note that I stated &amp;quot;I&#39;m a cat person&amp;quot; and not &amp;quot;I&#39;m a pet person&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that I much prefer &lt;em&gt;other people&#39;s pets&lt;/em&gt; to having my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s just so, so much easier. And cheaper. Don&#39;t want to forget cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All right, now that that&#39;s out of the way. Again, I really love our cat. He&#39;s a big ol&#39; gray and white beast that would rather just leave you alone so much as look at you. Which is totally cool with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t have to worry about him getting around my work area or laying on my laptop. I don&#39;t, generally, have to worry about him being underfoot. With the general exception of him racing me downstairs in a vain attempt to trip me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course life isn&#39;t all gumdrops and lollypops with the cantankerous cat around. No sir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&#39;s an indoor cat. If it&#39;s one thing that I like even less than pets it&#39;s fleas. Most likely because fleas &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; love me. So what&#39;s the one thing in all the world that this animal desires?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep. Uh huh. He absolutely desires to go outside. Even just the garage. And good golly gee whiz is he &lt;strong&gt;uber, super&lt;/strong&gt; vocal about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d swear, listening to this bad boy &lt;strong&gt;meowrl&lt;/strong&gt; just could drive me insane. Dude is loud. Like, if I didn&#39;t know better we&#39;d swear he was a she and not neutered (he is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a near constant ordeal, some days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have I told you I love my cat?&lt;/p&gt;

		  &lt;p&gt;Ah, the great and powerful Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually don&#39;t mind Mondays. Sure for some people it&#39;s the beginning of the work week (myself included), but it also means a great day of getting stuff done at work with little interruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally today we had about an hour long team meeting to discuss projects new/old/upcoming and other leadership tidbits. I don&#39;t mind, at least it wasn&#39;t a 3pm (4pm!) meeting on a Friday. Those stink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In household news, the granddaughter is starting to feel more and more comfortable. She does get a little upset and sad when her Dad leaves the room or goes to work, but it passes much quicker now than it used to. She&#39;s a whole lot happier and just seems to be in a better mood overall now. It&#39;s great to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we also found out what the final cost of repairs are going to be on the vehicle. Shockingly not as bad as I was anticipating, but then I did have a worse case scenario in my head, just so I could be relieved if that was not the case. It still hurts and is money out the door and straight into the incinerator, but it could have been about a thousand dollars worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now all we need is for a major appliance to vomit all over itself and call it a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s about time to get some dinner prepped, so off to do that I go.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Notes of yesterday</title>
		<link href="https://shanewrogers.lol/posts/notes-of-yesterday/"/>

		<id>https://shanewrogers.lol/posts/notes-of-yesterday/</id>
		<content type="html">
		  &lt;p&gt;I did not post anything yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After over a month of managing to get something put up, I skipped a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know what? That&#39;s okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not a habit until it becomes something more normal. I hope that days like yesterday are more the exception than the rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was some productivity that was had yesterday, despite the overnight rain I was able to get the lawn mowed and some other weeds taken care of. We&#39;ve got an older Snapper battery operated lawnmower, and I consider it a major accomplishment if I&#39;m able to get the lawn mowed within a single 4Ah battery. If I can get it weekly, it&#39;s usually possible, and only takes about an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I really need to run the weed eater though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second vehicle is still at the dealership, hopefully it&#39;s finished by Monday afternoon. It really stinks not having my car. Not that I go anywhere, or that I could go anywhere at this time. But still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve got a question into our insurance agent, wondering about a few things that are related about that vehicle issue, but I&#39;m not overly optimistic about any responses there. Certainly nothing favorable, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s getting close to that time to begin thinking about birthday gifts for the spouse. Sometimes I&#39;m just not really in a gift giving mood, and this seems to be one of those times. I do, however, think I know what I&#39;m going to get, so that&#39;s positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;last-week&#39;s-links&quot;&gt;Last Week&#39;s Links &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#last-week&#39;s-links&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I&#39;m going to start something new here, too, this week. In something of an effort to reduce the number of open tabs that I have on my phone, I&#39;m going to add to a listing of links that I&#39;ve found of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tiddlywiki.com/&quot;&gt;TiddlyWiki&lt;/a&gt; an older single file wiki based, server less, personal knowledge base application. I haven&#39;t used this in forever, it&#39;s good to see it&#39;s still kicking though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/how-to-install-and-configure-hubzilla/&quot;&gt;How to install and configure hubzilla&lt;/a&gt; I like the idea of Hubzilla, and I also like the idea of running my own fediverse something or other. I already have plenty of them, though, and don&#39;t need to &lt;em&gt;collect them all&lt;/em&gt; in this case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.itsfoss.com/ente-auth/&quot;&gt;Ente Auth&lt;/a&gt; I really need to get away from Google Authenticator, since it kinda stinks. You&#39;d think that Google would at least provide some kind of &lt;em&gt;search&lt;/em&gt; for theirs, but.... That&#39;s asking quite a lot. Ente seems pretty cool, they&#39;ve also got a photos replacement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cara.app/home&quot;&gt;Cara&lt;/a&gt; Something of an Instagram replacement that has had really good growth over the last few weeks from what I see. They have really strong safeguards and stances on AI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

		<title>Half a quartet</title>
		<link href="https://shanewrogers.lol/posts/half-a-quartet/"/>
		<updated>2024-06-07T15:05:11+00:00</updated>
		<id>https://shanewrogers.lol/posts/half-a-quartet/</id>
		<content type="html">
		  &lt;p&gt;Today we had a short conference with one of the music/band/orchestra teachers in the school district. One of the really cool things that our district provides (well, free it isn&#39;t...but it&#39;s available) is for incoming junior high students the opportunity to try out a variety of band and orchestra instruments over the course of four days, to see what they like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of our kids have participated at this point, the current kiddo just finished his stint up. He went into it grudgingly, steadfast in his thinking that he just wanted to play the violin and nothing else. We did find out, through the whole camp experience, that he is not able to play brass - kiddo was just not able to buzz his lips. That&#39;s perfectly acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the instrument styles, both I suppose would be woodwinds, he actually played very well. Clarinet and flute. Totally hilarious, especially when considering that he really, &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt;, did not want to go those days because he would just not be able to do anything at all with them. Ha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when all was said and done, what was his top choice? Well, still the violin. Totally cool. That said, his second choice was actually the flute. The actually also recommended that he try to choose the bass, he checked all the &amp;quot;hell yeahs!&amp;quot; on that one. Both the teacher that he worked with on bass, and  the assistant, were former bass players and were very excited to see how well he performed. Fortunately, those skills do translate well to the violin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, we should now have half of a string quartet in our home now.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Still wheely tired</title>

		  &lt;p&gt;Last evening I had the opportunity to update one of our Oracle applications. Something that I&#39;ve gone through a handful of times now and have been able to fairly well document. It&#39;s kind of a flaky system, in that it requires some toggles and buttons being pressed in a very specific order. A rather unorthodox and strange order in our opinion. But, I&#39;ve got it down to a science now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was uneventful. So excellent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the home news side, hopefully tomorrow we will get our second vehicle back after an accident with one of the wheels and a curb. Though it&#39;s kind of bittersweet, since it&#39;ll be a large bill. Definitely not looking forward to this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I&#39;m still tired and this whole vehicle situation doesn&#39;t help.&lt;/p&gt;

		  &lt;p&gt;I&#39;m thinking this is just gonna be a short little snippet of an update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is this part of me that wants to just take a couple of weeks and just &amp;quot;go&amp;quot;. No real destination, no real plans. Just get in the car and drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realistically, I&#39;d rather get on the bike and ride, but that&#39;s kind of challenging when one no longer has a bike to get onto. To qualify, when I refer to a bike, I&#39;m not talking about the peddle powered version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just me. Just on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m so tired.&lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2024-03-30T20:16:05+00:00</updated>
		<id>https://shanewrogers.lol/posts/another-day-another-day/</id>
		<content type="html">
		  &lt;h2 id=&quot;another-entry-in-the-daily-stuff&quot;&gt;Another entry in the daily stuff &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#another-entry-in-the-daily-stuff&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s see what we can do about getting something written on the daily, eh? I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll be successful here, but it&#39;s important to have some kind of goal I guess. I&#39;ll file these under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://shanewrogers.lol/tags/journal&quot; title=&quot;journal tags&quot;&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt; tag (note to self: come back and make that a proper link to the journal tag page) so I can do whatever with them in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today it&#39;s Saturday. Really, most normal adults/kids/people/pigs/horses/spiders/lizards/whatever would probably love a good weekend day. For some reason, I&#39;m not always a fan. I don&#39;t know why, I think it&#39;s because I miss working. Not that I&#39;m a workaholic, but I find that I enjoy what I do in my normal life. There&#39;s just too much stuff that needs to be done during the weekend to maintain a house and home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that I don&#39;t like that stuff, either. It&#39;s nearly lawn mowing season - I absolutely love mowing the lawn! I don&#39;t think that 12 year old me would believe that statement, but it&#39;s true. It&#39;s a time to put the buds in and listen to some nerdcore! (note to self: I should make a section dedicated to what I&#39;m listening to, perhaps pull in my lastfm stuff as a data collection via rss.) It&#39;s also about time to make another attempt at getting some fruit trees planted, which is always fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, I&#39;m just sitting here, typing away, listening to the &lt;em&gt;Snoopy Show&lt;/em&gt; on AppleTV. Outside, the weather is pretty nice, we&#39;ve got the rather large bounce house set up outside for the youngest kiddo, it&#39;s kinda noisy too. It&#39;s funny, you know, the things that we purchase for our kids: the things that we would have killed to have when we were young. A swing set slash jungle gym. A bounce house. Various playground type equipment. Stuff that never gets used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I guess that&#39;s not completely true. It does get used, some. Just not as much as one would have hoped. Meh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sigh, well, I&#39;m out of coffee. Of course, who needs coffee at three thirty in the afternoon? Stupid rhetorical question, that. I always need coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;setup-stuff%2C-emacs-wise&quot;&gt;Setup stuff, emacs wise &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#setup-stuff%2C-emacs-wise&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular emacs setup, what I&#39;m writing in now, from an older laptop running current Pop_OS, isn&#39;t really to my liking. Even though it&#39;s running the same doom setup as my work machine, it&#39;s not perfect. My work machine, I guess I can&#39;t really say that I run emacs from that device since I ssh into a locally hosted kvm box via wsl....meh, there are differences. I wish I could grok &lt;code&gt;guix&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;nixos&lt;/code&gt;, but alas, I&#39;m stil stuck in the realm of linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where was I? Oh yes, I do have &lt;code&gt;org-capture&lt;/code&gt; templates set up that work just fine. I need to get the popup capture buffer to take the whole frame, though. I don&#39;t like that it also visits the capture buffer in the originally opened frame as well. It&#39;s an annoyance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m sure there should be more. I think I&#39;m going to wait until I&#39;ve got more, eh, content, here before I get various rss feeds set up for feeding into some of my social sites. I feel that I should probably &amp;quot;own my social&amp;quot;, too, and I do have at least one I run - but it&#39;s certainly a chore. We shall see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, I&#39;m out.&lt;/p&gt;
